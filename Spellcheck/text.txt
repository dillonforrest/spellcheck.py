---------- Scene 1: Doorstep Delivery.  
---------- LOCATION: Privet Drive - night  
DUMBLEDORE: I should have known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumors true, Albus?  
DUMBLEDORE: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: And the boy?  
DUMBLEDORE: Hagrid is bringing him.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
DUMBLEDORE: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.   
HAGRID: Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall, ah.  
DUMBLEDORE: No problems I trust, Hagrid?  
HAGRID: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flyin’ over Bristol. Try not to wake 'im. There yeh go. 
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Albus, do you really think it's safe leaving him with these people? I've watched them all 
day. There're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable! They really are-  
DUMBLEDORE: ...the only family he has.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his 
name.  
DUMBLEDORE: Exactly. He's far better off growing up away from all of that- until he is ready.  
HAGRID: (Sniff) Ah.  
DUMBLEDORE: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all. Good luck, Harry Potter.

HARRY: Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, watching people press their ugly 
faces in on you. Can you hear me? It's just- I've never talked to a snake before. Do you- only, do you talk to people often? 
You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there? Do you miss your family? I see. That's me as well. I never knew my

UNCLE VERNON: I demand that you leave at once, sir. You are breaking and entering!

HARRY: Sorry, no.  
HAGRID: No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder how your mum and dad learned it all?  
HARRY: Learnt what?  
HAGRID: You're a wizard, Harry.  
HARRY: I- I'm a what?  
HAGRID: A wizard. And a thumpin' good un, I'd wager, once you're trained up a little.  
HARRY: No, you've made a mistake. I mean, I... can't be a, a, a wizard... I mean, I'm... just... Harry. Just Harry!  
HAGRID: Well, "Just Harry", did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain, when you were angry... 
or, or scared? Um- hum.  
DUDLEY: Oh, huh, huh...  
HARRY: "Dear Mr. Potter, we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry."  
UNCLE VERNON: He will not be going, I tell you! We swore when we took him in that we'd put a stop to all of this 
rubbish!  
HARRY: You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?  
AUNT PETUNIA: Of course, we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was? Oh, my mother 
and father were so proud the day she got her letter. 'We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful?' I was the only 
one to see her for what she was- a freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you
would be the same, just as strange, just as...abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown 
up, and we got landed with you.  
HARRY: Blown up?! You told me my parents died in a car crash!   
HAGRID: A car crash? A car crash kill Lily and James Potter?
AUNT PETUNIA: We had to say something. 
 HAGRID: It's an outrage! It's a scandal!  
UNCLE VERNON: He'll not be going.  
HAGRID: Oh-ho, ho, and I suppose a great Muggle like yerself is gonna stop him.  
HARRY: Muggle?  
HAGRID: Non-magic folk. This boy's had 'is name down since he were born. He's goin' to the finest school of 
witchcraft and wizardry in the world. And, he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus
Dumbledore...  
UNCLE VERNON: I will not pay to have some crackpot old fool teach him magic tricks!  
HAGRID: Never... insult... Albus Dumbledore... in front of me...  
DUDLEY: Whoa!  
AUNT PETUNIA: Ahh! Ahhh!  
UNCLE VERNON: Ahh! No!  DUDLEY: Ahh! Ahhh! Get it off! Get it off!  
HAGRID: Oh, uh- I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts abou' that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to 
do magic.  
HARRY: OK.

HARRY: But, why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there- how is it they know who I am?

HAGRID: Here's where you get your quills and your ink. And over there, all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.

Hogwarts. 
 ---------- LOCATION: Gringotts - lobby - daytime  
HARRY: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?  
HAGRID: They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come, goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stay close. 
Ahem...Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.  
GOBLIN: Ah- and does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?  
HAGRID: Oh, uh- wait a minute, got it here somewhere. Ha! There's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else, as 
well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about You-Know-What, in vault You-Know-Which.

--------- Scene 7: Ollivanders.  
---------- LOCATION: Diagon Alley - daytime  
HARRY: I still need... a wand.  
HAGRID: A wand? Well, you want Ollivander's. There ain't no place better. Why don't you run along there and wait. I've 
got one more thing to do. Won't be long.  
---------- LOCATION: Ollivanders Wand Shop - daytime  
HARRY: Hello? Hello?  
MR. OLLIVANDER: I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that you mother and father 
were in here buying their first wands. Ah... here we are. Well, give it a wave. Apparently not! Perhaps...this? No, no, 
definitely not. No matter. I wonder... Curious... very curious.  
HARRY: S-sorry, but what's curious? 
MR. OLLIVANDER: I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail 
feather resides in your wand gave another feather. Just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for 
this wand, when its brother gave you that scar.  
HARRY: And who owned that wand?  
MR. OLLIVANDER: We do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. 
But, I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great 
things. Terrible, yes. But great.   
HAGRID: Harry. Harry! Happy Birthday!  
HARRY: Wow!  
---------- Scene 8: The Boy Who Lived.  
---------- LOCATION: Leaky Cauldron - daytime  
HAGRID: You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.  
HARRY: He killed my parents didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid. I know you do.  
HAGRID: First, and understand this, Harry, because it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A 
few years ago, there was one wizard that went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-. His name was V- . 
HARRY: Well, maybe if you wrote it down?  
HAGRID: Nah, I can't spell it. All right... Voldemort.   
HARRY: Voldemort?
HAGRID: Shh! It was dark times, Harry, dark times.  
---------- LOCATION: Godric's Hollow - Potter house - exterior - night  
HAGRID: (voiceover) Voldemort started to gather some followers. Brought 'em over to the Dark Side. Anyone who

--------- LOCATION: Leaky Cauldron - daytime  
HARRY: Me? Voldemort tried to kill... me?  
HAGRID: Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a 
curse, and an evil curse at that.  
HARRY: What happened to V-... to You-Know-Who?  
HAGRID: Well, some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there still. Too tired to carry 
on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Somethin' about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's 
why everybody knows your name. You're 'The Boy Who Lived!'  
---------- Scene 9: Platform 9- 3/4.  
---------- LOCATION: London - King's Cross Station - daytime  
HAGRID: What're you lookin' at? Blimey, is that time!? Sorry, Harry, but I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore would 
be wantin' his... Well, he'll be wantin' to see me. Now, your train leaves in ten minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it Harry, 
that's very important. Stick to your ticket.  HARRY: Platform nine and three-quarters? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform nine and threequarters. There's no such thing, is there?  
---------- LOCATION: London - King's Cross Station - Train platform - daytime  
OTHER: Sorry.  
HARRY: Excuse me! Excuse me!  
STATION GUARD: On your left, Madam.  
HARRY: Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform nine and three-quarters?  
STATION GUARD: Nine and three-quarters? Think you're being funny, do ya? Nine and three-quarters...
MRS.WEASLEY: It's the same every year. Packed with Muggles, of course. Come on!   
HARRY: Muggles?  
MRS. WEASLEY: Platform nine and three-quarters, this way! All right, Percy, you first. Fred, you next.  
GEORGE: He's not Fred, I am!  
FRED: Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother!  
MRS. WEASLEY: Oh, I'm sorry, George.  
FRED: I'm only joking! I am Fred!  
HARRY: Excuse me! C- could you tell me... how to...  
MRS. WEASLEY: How to get onto the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. Now, 
all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms nine and ten. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're 
nervous.  
GINNY: Good luck!

sweared he got boogie-flavored one once.  
HARRY: These aren't real frogs, are they?  
RON: It's just a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I've got about five 
hundred meself. Watch it! Aw, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.  
HARRY: I've got Dumbledore!  
RON: I've got about six of him.  
HARRY: Hey, he's gone!  
RON: Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? This is Scabbers, by the way. Pathetic, isn't he?  
HARRY: Just a little bit.  
RON: Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?  
HARRY: Yeah!  
RON: Ahem... "Sun-"  
HERMIONE: Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.  RON: No.  
HERMIONE: Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.   
RON: Ahem. "Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow."  
HERMIONE: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course, I've only tried a few simple
ones myself. But they've all worked for me. For example: Oculus reparo. That's better, isn't it? Holy cricket! You're Harry 
Potter! I'm Hermione Granger. And... you are...?  
RON: I'm Ron Weasley.  
HERMIONE: Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. You've got dirt on your 
nose, by the way. Did you know? Just there.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments you will pass through these doors and 
join your classmates, but before you take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, 
Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you're here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs 
will earn you points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most 
points is awarded the house cup.  
NEVILLE: Trevor! Sorry.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily.  
DRACO: It's true then, what they were saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.  
NEVILLE: Harry Potter!  
OTHER: Harry Potter...  
DRACO: This is Crabbe, and   Goyle. And I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.  
RON: Heh- heh...  
DRACO: Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask you yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must 
be a Weasley. You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go 
making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.  
HARRY: I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: We're ready for you now. Follow me.  
---------- Scene 12: Sorting Hat.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Great Hall - decorated for Start of Term Feast - night  
HERMIONE: It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts, A 
History.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Now, will you wait along here, please. Now... before we begin, Professor Dumbledore 
would like to say a few words.  
DUMBLEDORE: I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the Dark 
Forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you that   the third 
floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death.
Thank you.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Now, when I call your name you will come forth, I shall place the Sorting Hat on your 
head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger!  
HERMIONE: Oh, no. OK, relax.

SORTING HAT: Ah, right then. Humm... right. Okay, Gryffindor!  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Draco Malfoy!  
SORTING HAT: Slytherin!  
RON: There's not a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.  PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Susan Bones!  
HARRY: Ow!  
RON: Harry, what is it?  
HARRY: Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.  
SORTING HAT: ...where shall I put you? Let's see... I know! Hufflepuff!  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Ronald Weasley!  
SORTING HAT: Ha! Another Weasley! I know just what to do with you... Gryffindor!  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Harry Potter.  
SORTING HAT: Hmmm... Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh   
yes, and a   thirst...to prove yourself. But, where to put you...  
HARRY: Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!   
SORTING HAT: Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It's all here in your head. And 
Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, there's no doubt about that. No?  
HARRY: (whispering) Please, please, anything but Slytherin, anything but Slytherin.  
SORTING HAT: Well, if you're sure, better be... Gryffindor!

PERCY: Oh,   Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.  
HARRY: What's he teach?  
PERCY: Potions. But, everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

transfigured Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocket watch? That way one of you might be on time.

appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few who possess the 
predisposition... I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, 
brew glory, and even put a stopper in death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of 
abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention. Mr. Potter... our new celebrity. Tell me, what 
would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? You don't know? Well, let's try 
again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?  
HARRY: I- I don't know, sir.

unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist nothing was taken. The vault in question, number

handle the Quaffle, and try to put it through one of those three hoops. The Keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. With 
me so far?  
HARRY: I think so. What are those?  
WOOD: You'd better take this. Careful now, it's coming back. Uh, not bad, Potter! You'd make a fair Beater. Uh-oh.

 WOOD: Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you... are a Seeker. The only thing I want you to worry about is this, the 
Golden Snitch.

HERMIONE: I went looking for the troll. I've read about them, and I thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry 
and Ron hadn't come and found me... I'd probably be dead.  PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Be that as it may, it was an extremely foolish thing to do. I would have expected more 
rational behavior on your part and I am very disappointed in you   Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from 
Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen, well, I just hope you realize how fortunate you 
are. Not many first year students could take on a fully-grown mountain troll, and live to tell the tale! Five points... 
will be awarded to each of you... for sheer dumb luck.

should be easy work for you. Even if it is against Slytherin.  
HARRY: That explains the blood.  
HERMIONE: Blood?  
HARRY: Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as diversion so he could try and get past that three-headed 
dog. But, he got himself bitten. That's why he's limping.  
HERMIONE: But, why would anyone go near that dog?  
HARRY: The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. Said it was Hogwarts business, very 
secret.  
HERMIONE: So you're saying...  
HARRY: That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.

this, Harry, this mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it. Even gone mad. That

HERMIONE: Honestly, don't you two read? 'The Sorcerer's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing 
powers. It will transform any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker 
immortal.'  
RON: Immortal!  
HERMIONE: It means you'll never die.  
RON: I know what it means!  HARRY: Shhh!  
HERMIONE: 'The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist who last 
year celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday.' That's what Fluffy's guarding on the third floor! That's what's 
under the trap door- the Sorcerer's Stone!

HARRY: Hagrid!  
HAGRID: Oh, hello. I don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today.  
HARRY, RON, HERMIONE: We know about the Sorcerer's Stone!   
HAGRID: Oh. 
HARRY: We think Snape's trying to steal it.   
HAGRID: Snape? Blimey, you're not still on abou' him, are you?  
HARRY: Hagrid! We know he's after the Stone, we just don't know why!  
HAGRID: Snape is one of the teachers protectin' the Stone! He's not abou' to steal it.  
HARRY: What?  
HAGRID: You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.  
HARRY: Wait a minute! 'One of the teachers?'  
HERMIONE: Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments?  
HAGRID: That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me. Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Heh, heh... Ain't a soul 
knows how, 'cept fer me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I should not have told you that. Ooh, ooh... 
Ow... Oooh... Ooh, ooh...  
HARRY: Hagrid, what exactly is that?  
HAGRID: That? It's ah... it's um...  
RON: I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?  
HAGRID: I won it! Off a stranger I met down at the pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid of it, as a matter o' fact.  
HERMIONE: Is that... a dragon?  
RON: That's not just a dragon! That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.  
HAGRID: Isn't he beau'iful? Oh, bless him. Look, he knows his mummy! Hello, Norbert!  
HARRY: Norbert?  
HAGRID: Yeah, well, he's gotta have a name, don' he? Don't you, Norbert? Te de de de de! Oh! Woah! Oooh, hoo, hoo, 
hoo, hoo! He'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. Who's that?  
HARRY: Malfoy!  
HAGRID: Oh, dear.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - grounds - night  
HARRY: Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I ever met him.   
RON: It's crazy! And worse, Malfoy knows.  
HERMIONE: I don't understand. Is that bad?  
RON: It's bad.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Good evening.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Transfiguration classroom - night  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Nothing, I repeat nothing, gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. 
Therefore, as punishment for your actions, fifty points will be taken.  
HARRY: Fifty!  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention. 
DRACO: Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said, 'the four of us.'  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, honorable as your intentions were, you, 
too, were out of bed after hours. You will join you classmates in detention.  
---------- Scene 25: Forbidden Forest.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - grounds - night  
FILCH: A pity they let the old punishments go, eh? There was a time detention would find you hanging by your
thumbs in the dungeons. God, I'll miss the screaming. You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job 
to do...inside the Dark Forest. A sorry lot, this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, 
are ya?  
HAGRID: Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.  
HERMIONE: Well, that's good isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.  HAGRID: Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? What if the other dragons are mean to 'im? He's only a baby, after 
all.  
FILCH: Oh, for God's sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the Forest, after all. Got to have your wits about 
ya...  
DRACO: The Forest? I thought that was a joke. We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are... 
werewolves!  
FILCH: Ah, there's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. Nighty-night.  
HAGRID: Right. Let's go.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Dark Forest - night  
HARRY: Hagrid, what is that?  
HAGRID: What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn blood, that is. I found one dead, a few weeks ago. Now, this 
one's been hurt bad by somethin'. So, it's our job to go and find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me...  
RON: Okay...  
HAGRID: And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.  
DRACO: Okay, then I get Fang!  
HAGRID: Fine. Jus' so's you know, he's a bloody coward.  
DRACO: You wait till my father hears about this! This is servant stuff.  
HARRY: If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.  
DRACO: Scared, Potter? Did you hear that?  
HARRY: Come on, Fang!  
DRACO: Scared!  
FANG: Grrrr...  
HARRY: What is it, Fang?  
DRACO: Ahhhhh! Ah! Ah! ...Ahhh! Ahh!  
FIRENZE: Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The Forest is not safe at this time. 
Especially for you.  
HARRY: But, what was that thing you saved me from?   
FIRENZE: A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you 
alive even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. For you have slain something so pure, that from 
the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half- life, a cursed life.  
HARRY: But, who would choose such a life?  
FIRENZE: Can you think of no one?  
HARRY: You mean to say, that that thing that killed the unicorn, that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemort? 
FIRENZE: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment, Mr. Potter?  
HARRY: The Sorcerer's Stone!  
FANG: Ruff! Ruff!  
HERMIONE: Harry!  
HAGRID: Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry?  
FIRENZE: Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.  
---------- Scene 26: Up to Something.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Gryffindor common room - night  
HERMIONE: You mean, You-Know-Who is out there, right now, in the Forest?  
HARRY: But he's weak. He's living off of unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for 
himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back. 
RON: But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to... kill you, do you?  
HARRY: I think if he'd had his chance he might have tried to kill me tonight.  
RON: (Gulp) And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final.  
HERMIONE: Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore! 
As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - outside - daytime  
HERMIONE: I'd always heard Hogwart's end-of-year exams were frightful, but I've found they're rather enjoyable.  
RON: Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?  
HARRY: My scar. It keeps burning.  
HERMIONE: It's happened before...  
HARRY: Not like this.  RON: Perhaps you should see the nurse.  
HARRY: I think it's a warning. It means danger's coming. Ah... Oh! Of course!  
HERMIONE: What is it?  
HARRY: Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger 
turns up who just happens to have one? I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their 
pocket? Why didn't I see it before?  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Hagrid's Hut - exterior - daytime  
HARRY: Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? What did he look like?  
HAGRID: I dunno.    I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.   
HARRY: This stranger though, you and he must have talked.  
HAGRID: Well, he- he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him, I said,    after Fluffy a dragon's 
gonna be no problem.  
HARRY: Did he seem interested in Fluffy?  
HAGRID: Well, o' course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three-headed dog, even if you're 
in the trade? But I told 'im, I said, I said, 'The trick with any beast is to know how to calm 'im. Take Fluffy, for example, 
just play him a bit o' music, and he falls straight to sleep.' I shouldn't have told you that. Where are you going?
Where are you- ?  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Transfiguration classroom - daytime  
HARRY: We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the 
Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.   
HARRY: He's gone! Now!    But, this is important! This is about the Sorcerer's Stone!  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: How do you know-?  
HARRY: Someone's going to try to steal it!  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: I don't know how you three found out about the Stone, but I assure you it is perfectly 
well protected. Now, would you go back to your dormitories, quietly.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - hallway - daytime  
HARRY: That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape. Which means, he knows how to get past 
Fluffy.   
HERMIONE: And with Dumbledore gone- 
SNAPE: Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors, such as yourselves, be doing inside on a day 
like this?  
HERMIONE: Ah, w- w- w... we- we were just-  
SNAPE: You ought to be    careful.    People will think you're... up to something.  
HERMIONE: Now, what do we do?

NEVILLE: No! I won't let you! You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again! I-I- I- I'll fight you!  
HERMIONE: Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this. Petrificus Totalus!
RON: (Gulp) You're a little scary sometimes, you know that. Brilliant, but scary.

RON: Ugh! He's got horrible breath.  
HARRY: We have to move its paw.  
RON: What?  
HARRY: Come on! Okay, push! I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. If something bad happens, get yourselves 
out! Does it seem a bit...quiet to you?

RON: Help!  
HARRY: What?  
HERMIONE: I remember reading something in Herbology.  
RON: Help!  
HERMIONE: Umm...  
RON: Help!

HARRY: I don't know. Strange...  
RON: Alohomora! Well, it was worth a try.  
HERMIONE: Urrgh! What are we going to do? There must be a thousand keys up there!  
RON: We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty, like the handle.  HARRY: There! I see it! The one with the broken wing!  
HERMIONE: What's wrong, Harry?  
HARRY: It's too simple.  
RON: Oh, go on Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest Seeker in a century!

bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the queen-side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight.  
HERMIONE: What happens now?  
RON: Well, white moves first, and then... we play.  
HERMIONE: Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like... real wizard's chess do you?

HERMIONE: What is it?  
HARRY: He's going to sacrifice himself!  
HERMIONE: No, you can't! There must be another way!  
RON: Do you wanna stop Snape from getting' that Stone, or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it! Not me. Not 
Hermione. You! Knight to H-3. Check. Ahh!  
HERMIONE: Ron!  
HARRY: No! Don't move! Don't forget, we're still playing! Checkmate! Take care of Ron, then go to the owlery. Send
a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right. I have to go on.  
HERMIONE: You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard. You really are.   
HARRY: Not as good as you.

Harry, just be careful.

HARRY: Ah...You? N-no, it can't be! Snape - he wa- he was the one-  
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: Yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he? Why next to him, who would suspect "p- p- 
poor st- st- stuttering Professor Quirrell?"   
HARRY: But- but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.  
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: No, dear boy, I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught on fire and 
broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse.  
HARRY: Snape was trying to save me?   
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween.  
HARRY: Then- then you let the troll in! 
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. When everyone else was running 
about the dungeon, Snape    went    to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely 
left me alone. But, he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I 
see myself holding the Stone. But, how do I get it?  
VOLDEMORT: Use the boy.  
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: Come here, Potter! Now! Tell me... what do you see? What is it, what do you see?  HARRY: I- I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I- I've won the House Cup.  
VOLDEMORT: He lies.  
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: Tell the truth! What do you see?  
VOLDEMORT: Let me speak to him.   
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: Master, you are not strong enough!  
VOLDEMORT:I have strength enough for this. Harry Potter, we meet again. 
HARRY: Voldemort? 
VOLDEMORT: Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite! 
Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, 
that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket.  
---------- Scene 31: Magic Touch.  
VOLDEMORT: Stop him! Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me... and live?  
HARRY: Never!  
VOLDEMORT: Ha, ha ha! Bravery. Your parents had it, too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father 
again? Together we can bring them back. All I ask is for something in return. That's it, Harry. There is no good and 
evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the 
Stone!  
HARRY: You liar!  
VOLDEMORT: Kill him!  
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: Ahh! Ahh-aaargh! What is this magic?  
VOLDEMORT: Fool! Get the Stone!

DUMBLEDORE: Good afternoon, Harry. Ah! Tokens from your    admirers.  
HARRY: Admirers?  
DUMBLEDORE: What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete 
secret. So, naturally, the whole school knows. Ahh, I see that your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening 
your Chocolate Frogs.  
HARRY: Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?  
DUMBLEDORE: Fine. They're both just fine.  
HARRY: But, what happened to the Stone?  
DUMBLEDORE: Relax, dear boy. The Stone    has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I have had a little chat, 
and agreed it was best all around.  
HARRY: But then, Flamel- he'll die won't he?  
DUMBLEDORE: He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.  
HARRY: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute, I was there staring in the mirror, and then the next-  
DUMBLEDORE: Ah,    you see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone- find it, but not use it- would be able 
to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And, between you and me, that is saying something.  
HARRY: Does that mean- with the Stone gone, that is- that Voldemort can never come back?  
DUMBLEDORE: Ah, I'm afraid... there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell 
couldn't bear to have you touch him? It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act 
leaves a mark. Oh, no- this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.  
HARRY: What is it?  
DUMBLEDORE: Love, Harry. Love. Ah, Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to 
come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then, I'm afraid I've lost my liking for them. But, I think I could be 
safe with a nice toffee. Hmm... Alas! Earwax!

stand as thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor with three hundred and twelve points. Third place, Hufflepuff with 
three hundred and fifty-two points. In second place, Ravenclaw with four hundred and twenty-six points.  And in first 
place, with four hundred and seventy- two points, Slytherin House.  
SLYTHERINS: Yeah! Yeah!  
DRACO: Nice one, mate.  
DUMBLEDORE: Yes, yes. Well done, Slytherin. Well done, Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into 
account. And, I have a few last-minute points to award. To Miss Hermione Granger, for the    cool    use of intellect 
when others were in grave peril, fifty points.  
GRYFFINDORS: Yeah!  
HARRY: Good job!  
DUMBLEDORE: Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best-played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen
these many years,    fifty points.  
GRYFFINDORS: Yeah!  
DUMBLEDORE: And third, to Mr. Harry Potter,    for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor 
House sixty points.  
GRYFFINDORS: Yeah! Yeah!  
HERMIONE: We're tied with Slytherin!  
DUMBLEDORE: And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies. But, a great deal more to 
stand up to your friends. I    award ten points to    Neville Longbottom.  
GRYFFINDORS: Yeah! Whoo! Whoo-hoo!  
DUMBLEDORE: Assuming my calculations are correct, I believe that a    change of decoration is in order. Gryffindor 
wins the House Cup!  
GRYFFINDORS: Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!

HARRY: Thanks, Hagrid.  
HAGRID: Oh, go on. On with you. On with you, now. On with you. Oh, and listen, Harry. If that dolt of a cousin o' yours, 
Dudley, gives you any grief, you can always, um... threaten 'im, with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail o' his.  
HARRY: But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.  
HAGRID: I do. But, your cousin don't, do he? Eh? Uh. Aye!

UNCLE VERNON: Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!  
HARRY: But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends... not one... all summer.  
DUDLEY: Who'd want to be friends with you?  
UNCLE VERNON: I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the 
food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts.  
AUNT PETUNIA: Not now, Bopkins. For when the Masons arrive.

DOBBY: Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobby understands! It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby 
wonders where to begin?   
HARRY: Why don't you sit down?  
DOBBY: S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho... Oh, ho, ho. Ohh, ho, hoo...  
HARRY: Dobby, ssh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to offend you, or anything.  
DOBBY: Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a 
wizard, like an equal.   
HARRY: You can't have met many decent wizards then.

DOBBY: The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby 
was here...ooh... But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him. Harry Potter must not go 
back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things

Daily Prophet.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: It can't be- Harry Potter?  
PHOTOGRAPHER: Harry Potter! Excuse me, madam.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, 
what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to 
purchase my autobiography, Magical Me,... which, incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily 
Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving... with my entire collected works, free of charge. 
Now, ladies?  
MRS. WEASLEY: Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That's it, Ron.  
DRACO: I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can't even go into a bookshop without 
making the front page..  
GINNY: Leave him alone
DRACO: Oh look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter... Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is 
legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.  
HARRY: Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his name...or very foolish.  
HERMIONE: Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: And you must be... Miss Granger. Yes, Draco's told me all about you, and your parents. Muggles, 
aren't they? Let me see...red hair... vacant expressions... tatty second hand book. You must be the Weasleys.  
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Children, it's mad in here! Let's go outside.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Well, well, well. Weasley senior.  
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Lucius.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they're paying you overtime,
but judging by the state of this, I'd say not. What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't 
even pay you well for it.  
ARTHUR WEASLEY: We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Clearly. Associating with Muggles... and I thought your family could sink no lower. I'll see you at 
work.

HERMIONE: Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It's 
also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry   is fatal to anyone who hears it.  
PROFESSOR SPROUT: Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now, as our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their 
cries won't kill you yet. But they could knock you out for several hours, which is why I have given each of you a pair 
of earmuffs for auditory protection. So, could you please put them on, right away? Quickly! Flaps tight down, and watch 
me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly, you pull it sharply up out of the pot... All: Aah! Ooh!

him warm.

HARRY: What's a Mudblood?  
HERMIONE: It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with 
non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.  
HAGRID: See, the thing is, Harry, there're some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think they're better'n everyone 
else because they're what people call "pure blood."  
HARRY: That's horrible!

HARRY: Did you hear it?  
RON: Hear what?  
HARRY: That voice.  
HERMIONE: Voice? What voice?  
HARRY: I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just-  VOICE: It's time.  
HARRY: It's moving. I think it's going to kill.  
RON: Kill?  
HERMIONE: Harry, wait! Not so fast!

HARRY: Strange. I've never seen spiders act like that.  
RON: I don't like spiders... What's that?  
HERMIONE: 'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened... enemies the heir... beware.' It's written in blood.  
HARRY: Oh, no... It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris.  
OTHERS: (mumble, mumble) Ahhh! What's that?  
MADAME POMFREY: Oh!  
DRACO: 'Enemies of the heir beware!' You'll be next, Mudbloods!  
FILCH: What's going on 'ere? Go on, make way, make way. Potter-- What are you...Mrs. Norris? You've...murdered 
my cat.  
HARRY: No. No.  
FILCH: I'll kill ya... I'll kill ya!  
DUMBLEDORE: Argus! Argus, I... Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except... you three. 
OTHER: Ravenclaws, follow me!  
DUMBLEDORE: She's not dead, Argus.    She has been Petrified.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Ah, thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the counter curse that could 
have spared her.  
DUMBLEDORE: But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say...  
FILCH: Ask him. It's him who's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall.  
HARRY: It's not true sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris.  
FILCH: Rubbish!  
SNAPE: If I might,    Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong 
time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail. 
HERMIONE: That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when he said...  
SNAPE: Yes, Miss Granger?  
HARRY: When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris. 
DUMBLEDORE: Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.  
FILCH: My cat has been Petrified. I wanna see some punishment!  
DUMBLEDORE: We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of 
Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly 
recommend caution... to all. 
 ---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - moving staircase - night  
HERMIONE: It's a bit strange, isn't it?  
HARRY: Strange?  
HERMIONE: You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just... strange. 
HARRY: Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?  
RON: Are you mad?  
HERMIONE: No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,    hearing voices    isn't a good sign.

---------- Scene 14: About the Chamber.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Transfiguration classroom - daytime  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals 
into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three, Vera verto. Now it's your turn. Well, who would like to go first? Ah! Mr. 
Weasley. "One, two, three. Vera verto." RON: Ahem. Vera verto!  
OTHERS: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss Granger?  
HERMIONE: Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about...the Chamber of Secrets?  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a 
thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, 
Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not.  
RON: Three guesses who.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to 
Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, "pure-bloods." 
Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden 
chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time 
when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the 
horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.  
HERMIONE: Muggle-borns.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Well, naturally, the school had been searched many times. No such chamber has 
been found.  
HERMIONE: Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Well, the Chamber is said to home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can 
control. It is said to be the home of a monster. 
 ---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - hallway - daytime  RON: D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?  
HERMIONE: Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.  
HARRY: Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means---  
HERMIONE: The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?  
RON: Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?  
HERMIONE: If you're talking about Malfoy-  
RON: Of course. You heard him! 'You'll be next Mudbloods,'  
HERMIONE: I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?  
HARRY: Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin
for centuries.  
RON: Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.  
HERMIONE: Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to 
mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous.  
---------- Scene 15: Rogue Bludger.
 ---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Library - daytime  
HERMIONE: Here it is. 'The Polyjuice Potion.' (Reading from Moste Potente Potions) 'Properly brewed, the Polyjuice 
Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.'  
RON: Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?  
HERMIONE: Yes.  
RON: Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything.  
HERMIONE: Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.  
HARRY: Well, how long will it take to make?  
HERMIONE: A month.  
HARRY: A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the 
school by then.  
HERMIONE: I know. But it's the only plan we've got.

HERMIONE: You will be able to, won't you?  
MADAME POMFREY: Oh, I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing 
bones is a nasty business.

DOBBY: Hello!  
HARRY: Dobby?  
DOBBY: Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby! Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed 
the train.  
HARRY: It was you... You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.  
DOBBY: Indeed. Yes, sir.  
HARRY: You nearly got Ron and me expelled!  
DOBBY: At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be 
enough to make Harry Potter see that---  
HARRY: Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?  
DOBBY: Uhuh... Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands.  
HARRY: You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!  
DOBBY: Uh-huh-huh... Dobby is used to death threats sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.  
HARRY: I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?  
DOBBY: Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-WhoMust-Not-Be-Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like
vermin...uh, huh, huh, huh! Aah, ahh...  
HARRY: Why do you wear that thing Dobby?  
DOBBY: This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elves' enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him 
with clothes. Ah! Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now 
that history is to repeat itself.  
HARRY: Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?  
DOBBY: Ah! I shouldn't have said that! Oh! Ah! Dah! Bad Dobby! Bad!  
HARRY: Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now? 
DOBBY: Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.  
HARRY: No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?  
DOBBY: (Snap!)  
MADAME POMFREY: Put him here. What happened?  
DUMBLEDORE: There's been another attack.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: I think- do ya know- I think he's been Petrified, Madame Pomfrey. Look! Perhaps he 
managed to take a picture of his attacker... (Poof)  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: What can this mean, Albus?  
DUMBLEDORE: It means...that our students are in great danger.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: What should I tell the staff.  
DUMBLEDORE: The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets 
has indeed been opened again.  
---------- Scene 17: Dueling Club.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Girl's bathroom - daytime  
HERMIONE: Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?  
RON: Of course. Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. And now he's
taught Draco how to do it.  
HERMIONE: Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.  
RON: Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girl's lavatory? Don't you think 
we'll get caught?  
HERMIONE: Heh... No. No one ever comes in here.  
RON: Why?  
HERMIONE: Moaning Myrtle.  
RON: Who?  
HERMIONE: Moaning Myrtle.  
RON: Who's Moaning Myrtle?

---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Great Hall - set up for Dueling Club - daytime  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Gather 'round, gather 'round! Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent!
In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little 
Dueling Club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves, as I myself have done on countless 
occasions- for full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has 
sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry- you'll 
still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear. One, two, three-  
SNAPE: Expelliarmus!  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Whoaah!  
HERMIONE: Do you think he's all right?  
RON: Who cares?  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind me saying, 
it was pretty obvious- ah- what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too 
easy.  SNAPE: Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah... Let's have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, 
Weasley, how about you?  
SNAPE: Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing 
in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Good luck, Potter.  
HARRY: Thank you, sir.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Wands at the ready.  
DRACO: Scared, Potter?  
HARRY: You wish.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: On the count of three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent- only to disarm. We 
don't want any accidents here. One, two—

RON: You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us?  
HARRY: I'm a what?  
HERMIONE: You can talk to snakes.  
HARRY: I know. I mean,    I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Uh, once! But, so what? 
I bet loads of people here can do it.
HERMIONE: No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad.  
HARRY: What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin-  
RON: Oh, that's what you said to it!  
HARRY: You were there! You heard me!  
RON: I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?  
HARRY: I spoke a different language? But- I didn't realize I- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?  
HERMIONE: I don't know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. 
There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to 
snakes, too.  
RON: Exactly!    Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great- great- great grandson, or something.
HARRY: But I'm not... I can't be.

day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn 
from the ashes.  
FAWKES: (Brrrt)

Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to

Slytherin!  
HARRY (as GOYLE): But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.  
DRACO: You know I don't Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my 
father did say this: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it- - only that they 
were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, it's only a matter of time 
before one of them is killed this time. As for me, I hope it's Granger. What's the matter with you two? You're acting 
very...odd.

Professor? DUMBLEDORE: I understand Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice.  
TOM RIDDLE: Sir- if it all stopped-    if the person responsible was caught— 
DUMBLEDORE: Is there something you wish to tell me?  
TOM RIDDLE: No, sir. Nothing.  
DUMBLEDORE: Very well, then. Off you go.  
TOM RIDDLE: Good night, sir.

HAGRID: Let's get yeh out of there.  
TOM RIDDLE: Evening, Hagrid. I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone, 
but—
HAGRID: You can't! You don't understand.  
TOM RIDDLE: The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing 
that killed their daughter is slaughtered.  
HAGRID: It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one! Never!  
TOM RIDDLE: Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside.  
HAGRID: No!  
TOM RIDDLE: Stand aside, Hagrid!  
HAGRID: No!  
TOM RIDDLE: Cistem aperio! Arania exumai!  
HAGRID: Aragog! Aragog!  
TOM RIDDLE: I can't let you go. They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled.

HARRY: It was Hagrid.    Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.
HERMIONE: It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.  
RON: We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.  
HARRY: The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?  
HERMIONE: Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?  
RON: That'll be a cheerful visit! "Hello, Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in 
the castle lately?"  
HAGRID: Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me now, would ya?  
HARRY, RON, HERMIONE: No!  
HARRY: W- what's that you've got, Hagrid?  
HAGRID: Oh, It's a- Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, ya know. Now, accordin' to Professor Sprout, they've 
still got a bit o' growing up to do. But, once their acne's cleared up, we'll be able to chop 'em up and stew 'em, and then 
we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three had best be lookin' after 
yourselves. All right? Hmm.  
HAGRID: Hello, Neville!  
NEVILLE: Harry- I don't know who did it, but you'd better come! Come on!  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Gryffindor boys’ dormitory  
HERMIONE: It had to be a Gryffindor.    Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn't a student.  
RON: Who ever it was, they must have been looking for something.  
HARRY: And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Quidditch team tent - daytime  
WOOD: Alright, listen up. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter. 
FRED: And not to mention, they're dead scared that Harry'll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him.  
WOOD: Well, that too. Professor McGonagall.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: This match has been cancelled.  
WOOD: We can't cancel Quidditch.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and 
I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Hospital wing - daytime  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: I warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock.  RON: Hermione!  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: She was found near the Library, along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you?  
HARRY: No.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Gryffindor common room - daytime  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Could I have your attention please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put 
into effect immediately. "All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock every evening. All 
students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions." I should tell you this: unless the culprit behind 
these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed.  
HARRY: We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll 
know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start.  
RON: But you heard McGonagall! We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.  
HARRY: I think it's time to get my Dad's old cloak out again.

HARRY: What's that for?  
HAGRID: Oh, nothing. I- I was expecting, ah... It doesn't matter- come on in- I just made a pot o' tea.  
HARRY: Hagrid, are you okay?  
HAGRID: I'm fine! I'm alright.  
HARRY: Did you hear about Hermione?  
HAGRID: Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all righ'.  
HARRY: Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?  
HAGRID: What you had to understand about that is- (knock, knock, knock) Quick under the cloak. Don't say a word. Be 
quiet, both o' you... Professor Dumbledore, sir!  
DUMBLEDORE: Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we...?  
HAGRID: Of course! Come in! Come in.  
RON: That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come-- three attacks on Muggle-borns. 
Things have gone far enough. The Ministry's got to act.  
HAGRID: Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!  
DUMBLEDORE: I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence.  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Albus look, Hagrid's record is against him.     I've got to take him.  
HAGRID: Take me? Take me where?    Not Azkaban Prison?  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Already here, Fudge? Good...  
HAGRID: What're you doin' here? Get outta my house!  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure     being inside your-- 
you call this a house? Huh! No. I simply called at the school, and was told the headmaster was here.
DUMBLEDORE: Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?  
LUCIUS MALFOY: The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside. This is an order of 
suspension. You'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch. Well, what, with 
all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be 
to the school.  
HAGRID: Yeh can' take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance!
You mark my words, there'll be killin's next!  
LUCIUS MALFOY: You think so?  
DUMBLEDORE: Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I will, of course, step aside.    However,
you will find that     help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Come, Hagrid... Well?  
HAGRID: Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they'd have to do would be to follow the 
spiders. Yup! That would lead them right! That's all I have to say. Oh, and someone'll need to feed Fang while I'm 
away.  
FANG: (Grrr...)  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Good boy.  
RON: Hagrid's right! With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day!  
HARRY: Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!  
---------- Scene 26: Aragog.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Hagrid's hut - exterior - night  
HARRY: Come on!  
RON: What?!  
HARRY: You heard what Hagrid said; 'Follow the spiders.'  
RON: They're headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders! Why couldn't it be "follow the butterflies?" 
 ---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Dark Forest - night  
RON: Harry, I don't like this... Harry, I don't like this at all!  
HARRY: Shush!  RON: Can we go back now?  
HARRY: Come on!  
ARAGOG: Who is it?  
HARRY: Don't panic.  
ARAGOG: Hagrid? Is that you?  
HARRY: We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? Y- y-you're Aragog aren't you?  
ARAGOG: Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.  
HARRY: He's in trouble.    Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the 
Chamber of Secrets, like before.  
ARAGOG: That's a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.  
HARRY: Then you're not the monster.  
ARAGOG: No! The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler. 
RON: Harry.  
HARRY: Shush. But if you're not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago? 
ARAGOG: We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.  
HARRY: But have you seen it?  
ARAGOG: I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a 
bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here.  
RON: Harry!  
HARRY: What?  
RON: Ahh- hhh...  
---------- Scene 27: Spider attack.  
HARRY: Well, thank you. We'll just...go.  
ARAGOG: Go? I think not.    My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them 
fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.  
RON: Can we panic now?  
RON: Know any spells?  
HARRY: One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.  
RON: Where's Hermione when you need her?  
HARRY: Let's go! Arania exumai! Go!  
HARRY, RON: Whoah!  
RON: Glad we're out of there. Ah- Aaaah!  
HARRY: Arania exumai! 
RON: Thanks for that.  
HARRY: Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move faster!  
HARRY, RON: Aah!  
HARRY: Go on! Go! Get us in the air.  
RON: The flying gear's jammed!  
HARRY: Come on! Pull!  
RON: I'm trying!  
RON: Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him! I mean, what was the point 
of sending us in there? What have we found out?  
HARRY: We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.

---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - exterior - dusk  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Hospital wing - dusk  
HARRY: Wish you were here Hermione. We need you... now, more than ever.  
RON: What's that?  
HARRY: Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked. Come on!  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - corridor - night  
HARRY: 'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living 
for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it.' Ron, this is it.
The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.    That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake!  
RON: But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?  
HARRY: Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin...Justin 
must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but he's a ghost- he 
couldn't die again. And Hermione...had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case 
it came along.  
RON: And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.  
HARRY: The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection.    'Spiders flee 
before it.' It all fits!  
RON: But how's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake- someone would have seen it.  
HARRY: Hermione's answered that, too.  
RON: Pipes? It's    using the plumbing!  
HARRY: Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left? 
RON: Moaning Myrtle.  PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the
second floor corridor, immediately. 
 ----------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - corridor - night  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been 
realized. A student has been taken by the monster    into the Chamber itself.    The students must be sent home. I'm 
afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: So sorry- dozed off- what have I missed?  
SNAPE: A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come, at last.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: My m-moment?  
SNAPE: Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of 
Secrets is?  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Well, that's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after 
all, are legend.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Very well- ah- I'll just be in my office getting, um- getting ready.  
MADAME POMFREY: Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Ginny Weasley.  
RON: 'Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.' Ginny...

PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Uh, ah- well, yes- um, urgent call- unavoidable- got to go.  
RON: What about my sister?!  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Well, um- as to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I.  
RON: You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Well- I must say- when I took the job there was nothing in the job description about a-  
HARRY: You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Books can be misleading!  
HARRY: You wrote them!  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if 
people didn't think I'd done all those things!  
HARRY: You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!  
RON: Is there anything you can do?  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those 
wizards would have gone blabbing. And I'd never have sold another book. In fact, ah...I'm ah...going to have to do the 
same to you.  
HARRY: Don't even think about it.

MOANING MYRTLE: Oh! Who's there? Oh! Hello, Harry! Ron. What do you want?  
HARRY: To ask you how you died.  
MOANING MYRTLE: Oh! It was dreadful. It happened right here    in this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive 
Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.    I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in.  
HARRY: Who was it Myrtle?  
MOANING MYRTLE: I don't know. I was Distraught! Huhh-huh...But they said something funny, a kind of made up 
language. And I realized it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and... I died.  
HARRY: Just like that? How?  
MOANING MYRTLE: I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes...over there, by that sink. Ohhhhooo... 
HARRY: This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.  
RON: Say something. Harry,    say something in Parseltongue!  
HARRY: Hesha- Hassah.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Excellent, Harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, I'll just be, ah... There's no need for me to stay. 
HARRY: Oh, yes there is! You    first.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Now, boys what good will it do?  
RON: Better you than us.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Um...but...obviously, yes. Sure you don't want to test it first? No! Aaaah! It's really quite filthy 
down here.  
HARRY: All right. Let's go.  
MOANING MYRTLE: Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet. Hee, hee.  
HARRY: Uh...thanks Myrtle.

PROFESSOR LOCKHART: It looks like a... snake.  
HARRY: It's a snakeskin.  
RON: Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! Heart of a lion, this one.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too 
late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first, Mr. 
Potter. Say good-bye to your memories.    Obliviate!  
RON: Harry! Harry!  
HARRY: Ron! Ron, are you ok?  
RON: I'm fine!  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Uhh... Hello. Who are you?  
RON: Um...Ron Weasley.  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Really? And uh, who- who am I?  
RON: Lockhart's memory charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is!  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: It's an odd sort of place this, isn't it? Do you live here?  
RON: No!  
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Really? Well-  
RON: What'll do I do now?  
HARRY: You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny!

---------- Scene 31: Heir of Slytherin.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Chamber of Secrets  
HARRY: Ginny... Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please don't be dead.    Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!  
TOM RIDDLE: She won't wake.  
HARRY: Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, 'she won't wake?' She's not...?  
TOM RIDDLE: She's still alive, but only just.  
HARRY: Are you a ghost?  
TOM RIDDLE: A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.  
HARRY: She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up! You've got to help me, Tom.    There's a basilisk.  
TOM RIDDLE: It won't come until it's called.  
HARRY: Give me my wand, Tom.  
TOM RIDDLE: You won't be needing it.  
HARRY: Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her!  
TOM RIDDLE: I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was 
Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.  
HARRY: No. She couldn't. She wouldn't!  
TOM RIDDLE: It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the    Mudbloods and Filch's cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening 
messages on the walls.  
HARRY: But why?  
TOM RIDDLE: Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. 
She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it
in the girl's bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet.  
HARRY: But, why did you want to meet me?  
TOM RIDDLE: I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless 
oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust.  
HARRY: Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?  
TOM RIDDLE: It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.  
HARRY: I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
 TOM RIDDLE: He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the 
Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self 
in its pages, so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.  
HARRY: Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone 
who was Petrified will be all right again.  
TOM RIDDLE: Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my 
new target... has been you. How is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the 
greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were 
destroyed?  
HARRY: Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.  
TOM RIDDLE: Voldemort is my past, present, and future. (writes in the air) TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE (rearranges) I 
AM LORD VOLDEMORT  
HARRY: You! You're the Heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.  
TOM RIDDLE: Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a 
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer 
in the world.  
HARRY: Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!  
TOM RIDDLE: Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!  
HARRY: He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?  TOM RIDDLE: So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird and an old hat. Shearhas- 
Samnathas- Selithaeine.  
---------- Scene 32: The Basilisk.  
TOM RIDDLE: Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter.
Sethae- He- This. Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me!  
TOM RIDDLE: No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you!  
TOM RIDDLE: Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a 
memory. Lord Voldemort will return- very... much... alive!  
HARRY: Ginny-  
---------- Scene 33: Healing powers.  
TOM RIDDLE: Remarkable isn't it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I'd guess you have little 
more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little 
book can do... especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. What are you doing? Stop. No! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!  
HARRY: Ginny...  
GINNY: Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn't mean to! Riddle made me, and... Harry, you're hurt!  
HARRY: Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, 
Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough... Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It's alright, Ginny. It's over. 
It's just a memory.

---------- Scene 34: Out of the hat.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Dumbledore's office - morning  
DUMBLEDORE: You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules? 
HARRY, RON: Yes, sir.  
DUMBLEDORE: And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.  
HARRY, RON: Yes, sir.  
DUMBLEDORE: Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School.  
RON: Thanks, sir!  
DUMBLEDORE: And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- 
we want our gamekeeper back. Harry... first,    I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty 
down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um... second, I sense that something 
is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?  
HARRY: It's just... You see, sir I- I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle 
and me.  
DUMBLEDORE: I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak 
Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.  
HARRY: Voldemort transferred some of his powers... to me?  
DUMBLEDORE: Not intentionally, but yes.  
HARRY: So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.  
DUMBLEDORE: It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination,      
resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in 
Gryffindor?  
HARRY: Because I asked it to.  
DUMBLEDORE: Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you    different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show 
what we truly are. It is our choices.    If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look 
more closely at this. Be careful.  
HARRY: Godric Gryffindor.  
DUMBLEDORE: Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.  
---------- Scene 35: Dobby's reward.  
HARRY: Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the Malfoys.  
DOBBY: Um-humm...  
LUCIUS MALFOY: I'll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, it's true-- you have returned!  
DUMBLEDORE: When the    governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw 
fit to summon me back.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Ridiculous!  
DUMBLEDORE: Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if 
they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: How dare you?!  
DUMBLEDORE: I beg your pardon?  
LUCIUS MALFOY: My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its 
students. The culprit has been identified, I presume?  
DUMBLEDORE: Oh, yes.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: And? Who was it?  
DUMBLEDORE:    Voldemort.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Ah!  DUMBLEDORE: Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: I see.  
DUMBLEDORE: Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old 
school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.  
HARRY: Don't worry. I will be.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Dumbledore. Come, Dobby.    We're leaving.  
DOBBY: Ahh! Oow!  
HARRY: Sir, I wonder if I could have that?  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - hallway - daytime  
HARRY: Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.  
HARRY: Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley. 
LUCIUS MALFOY: You do, do you? Why don't you prove it? Come, Dobby. Dobby!  
HARRY: Open it.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Dobby?  
DOBBY: Master has given Dobby a sock!  
LUCIUS MALFOY: What? I didn't give-  
DOBBY: Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!  
LUCIUS MALFOY: You've lost me my servant!  
DOBBY: You shall not harm Harry Potter!  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Advada-  
LUCIUS MALFOY: Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to 
meet the same sticky end!  
DOBBY: Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?  
HARRY: Just promise me something.  
DOBBY: Anything, sir!  
HARRY: Never try to save my life again.

HERMIONE: Thanks.  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Could I have your attention, please?  
DUMBLEDORE: Before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, 
whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of the recent 
events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled.  
HERMIONE: Oh, no!  
HAGRID: Sorry I'm late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. 
And I'd just like to say that a- if it hadn't been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, o' course, I would- uh- I'd still be 
you-know-where, so I- I'd just like to say 'Thanks.'

with twelve dogs. A bit more... That's a boy. Umm. Aah. You want to try a little drop of brandy? A little bit 'o brundy- 
brandy-wundy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?... What are you smirking at?  
HARRY: (shrug)  
AUNT MARGE: Where is it you send the boy, Vernon?  
UNCLE VERNON: St. Brutus's. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.  
AUNT MARGE: Do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?  
HARRY: Oh, yeah. Yeah- I've, I've been beaten loads of times. Umm.  
AUNT MARGE: Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who 
deserve it. Heh- But you mustn't blame yourself about how this one's turned out, Vernon. It's all to do with blood. 
Bad blood will out. What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?  
AUNT PETUNIA: Nothing. Uh, he did... he didn't work. He was- was- unemployed.  AUNT MARGE: And a drunk, too, no doubt-  
HARRY: That's a lie.  
AUNT MARGE: What did you say?  
HARRY: My dad wasn't a drunk. 
 AUNT PETUNIA: Oh!  
AUNT MARGE: Oh, huh-ha! Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip.  
UNCLE VERNON: I think it's time you went to bed.  
AUNT MARGE: Quiet, Vernon. You- clean it up! Actually, it's nothing to do with the father. It's all to do with the mother. 
You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the 
pup...  
HARRY: Shut up! Shut up!  
AUNT MARGE: Umm. Right. Let me tell you... y- ye...

TOM: Right smart bird you've got there, Mr. Potter. He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Eh-hem... As the Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter, that earlier this 
evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. She has been properly punctured and her memory modified. She will have 
no recollection of the incident whatsoever. So, that's that... and no harm done. Pea soup?  
HARRY: Uh- no thank you. Um, Minister...  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Yes?  
HARRY: I don't understand.  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Understand?  
HARRY: I broke the law. Underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home –  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Oh, come now, Harry. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts!  
TOM: Huh, huh, huh, huh!  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things, was very, very irresponsible.  
HARRY: 'The state of things' sir?  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: We have a killer on the loose.  
HARRY: Sirius Black, you mean? But, what's he got to do with me?  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Uh-hmm? Oh, nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters. And tomorrow you'll be 
on your way back to Hogwarts. Oh- ah, these are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty of having them brought here for 
you. Now, Tom will show you to your room.  
HARRY: Hedwig! 
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here it would be best if you didn't, ah... wander.

ARTHUR WEASLEY: Looking forward to a new term?  
HARRY: Yeah, it should be great.  
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Harry, there are some within the Ministry who would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm 
about to reveal to you. But, I think that you need to know the facts. You are in danger. Grave danger.  
HARRY: Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir? 
 ARTHUR WEASLEY: What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?  
HARRY: Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.  
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Do you know why? Harry, thirteen years ago, when you stopped...  
HARRY: Voldemort...?  
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Don't say his name.  
HARRY: Sorry.  
ARTHUR WEASLEY: ...when you stopped You-Know-Who, Black lost everything. But, to this day he still remains a faithful 
servant. And, in his mind, you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power. And that is 
why he has escaped from Azkaban. To find you.  
HARRY: And kill me.  
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Harry. I want you to swear to me that whatever you might hear -- you won't go looking for 
Black.

RON: Sure... except, no one's ever    broken out of Azkaban before, and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.  
HARRY: Thanks, Ron.  
HERMIONE: Why are we stopping?   We can't be there yet...  
RON: What's going on?  
HARRY: Dunno... maybe we've broken down.

LUPIN: Here, eat this. It'll help. It's alright, it's chocolate.  
HARRY: Wh- what was that thing... that came?  
LUPIN: It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. It was searching the train for Sirius Black. If 
you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver. Eat. You'll feel better.  
HARRY: What happened to me?  
RON: Well,    you sort of    went rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.  
HARRY: And... and did either of you two? You know... pass out?  
RON: No.    I felt weird, though. Like I'd never be cheerful again.

cauldron bubble. Double, double toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble! Something wicked this way comes!  DUMBLEDORE: Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all 
become too befuddled by our excellent feast. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R. J. Lupin, who's kindly 
consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Good luck, Professor!  
ALL: (applause)  
HERMIONE: Of course! That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.  
DRACO: Potter... Potter! Is it true you fainted?  
OTHER: Ohhhh!  
DRACO: I mean, you actually fainted?  
RON: Shove off, Malfoy.  
HARRY: How did he find out?  
HERMIONE: Just forget it.  
DUMBLEDORE: As some of you may know, Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher for many 
years, has decided to retire    in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to
announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid!  
ALL: (Applause)  
HERMIONE: Whoo-hoo!  
DUMBLEDORE: Finally, on a more disquieting note, at the request of the Ministry of Magic, Hogwarts will, until further 
notice, play    host to    the dementors of Azkaban, until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. The dementors will be 
stationed at every entrance to the grounds. Now, whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our dayto-day activities... a word of caution. dementors are vicious creatures. They will not distinguish between the one they 
hunt, and the one who gets in their way. Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to 
harm you. It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But, you know, happiness can be found even in the 
darkest of times... if only one remembers to turn on the light.

room, you shall discover if you possess... 'the Sight'! Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together, we shall cast ourselves 
into the future. This term we shall be focusing on Tasseomancy, which is the art of reading tea leaves. So please, take the 
cup of the person sitting opposite you... What do you see? The truth lies buried, like a sentence deep within a book, 
waiting to be read. But first, you must broaden your minds. First, you must look... beyond!  
HERMIONE: What a load of rubbish.  
RON: Where did you come from?  
HERMIONE: Me? I've been here all this time.  
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: You, boy! Is your grandmother quite well?  
NEVILLE: Ah... I- I think so.  
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup. Oh, umm. Pity. Broaden your minds. 
Hmmm. Woah! Your aura is pulsing, dear! Are you in the beyond? I think you are!  
RON: Sure.  
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: Look at the cup. Tell me what you see.  
RON: Oh, yeah, um, well, Harry's got a sort of a wonky cross- that's trials and suffering- and, uh, that there could be 
the sun- and that's happiness- so, ah, you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be    happy about it.  
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: Give me the cup. Oh- aah! Oh, dear boy.    My dear...you have the Grim!  
SEAMUS: The Grin? What's the Grin?  
BEM: Not the grin, you idiot. The Grim. 'Taking the form of a giant spectral dog, it's among the darkest omens in our 
world. It's an omen of death.'

HERMIONE: Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a very wooly discipline. Now, Ancient Runes. That's a 
fascinating subject.  
RON: Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking this term?  
HERMIONE: A fair few.  
RON: Hang on. That's not possible. Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination. You'd have to be in two classes at 
once!  
HERMIONE: Don't be silly, Ronald. How could anyone be in two classes at once? 'Broaden your minds... use your inner 
eye to see the future...'

creatures. Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff. It may just be the las' thing yeh ever do. Now, 
who'd like ter come an' say hello?  
HAGRID: Well done, Harry! Well done. Come on, now. Now, you have to let 'im make the firs' move. It's only polite. So, 
step up, give 'im a nice bow. Then you wait and see if he bows back. And if he does, you can go and touch him. If not- 
well, we'll get to that later. Just make your bow. Nice and low.  
HAGRID: Back off, Harry! Back off! Keep still. Keep still. Oh, ho! Well done, Harry! Well done! Here, ya big brute, ya... 
Right. I think you can go and pat 'im now. Go on. Don't be shy.  
OTHER: Ow!  
HAGRID: Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow. Not so fast, Harry. Slow down, Harry. That's it... nice and slow. Now 
let 'im come to you. That's it. Slowly, now, slowly, slowly, that's it... Yes! Well done! Well done, Harry! Well done!  
OTHER: Does he get to fly?  
HAGRID: I think he may let you ride 'im now.  
HARRY: What?  
HAGRID: Come on.  
HARRY: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... hey! Hagrid...

LUPIN: Intriguing, isn't it? Would anyone like to venture a guess... as to what is inside?  
DEAN THOMSAS: That's a Boggart, that is.  
LUPIN: Very good, Mr. Thomas. Now, can anybody tell me what a Boggart looks like?  
HERMIONE: No one knows.  
RON: When'd she get here?  HERMIONE: Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most. That's 
what makes them so –  
LUPIN: -so terrifying, yes, yes, yes. Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a Boggart. Let's practice it now. Ah, 
without wands, please... after me... Riddikulus!  
STUDENTS: Riddikulus!
LUPIN: Very good. A little louder, and very clear. Listen: Riddikulus!  
STUDENTS: Riddikulus!  
DRACO: This class is ridiculous.  
LUPIN: Very good- well, so much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough. What really finishes 
a Boggart is... laughter. You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. Let me explain. Ah- Neville, 
would you join me, please? Come on. Don't be shy, come on. Come on.  
LUPIN: Hello. Neville, what    frightens you most of all?  
NEVILLE: Profter... S- Snafpt...  
LUPIN: Sorry-  
NEVILLE: Professor Snape.  
LUPIN: Professor Snape. Yes, frightens us all. And I believe you live with your grandmother?  
NEVILLE: Yes, but I don't want that Boggart to turn into her, either.  
LUPIN: No...It won't. I want you to picture her clothes, only her clothes, very clearly in your mind.  
NEVILLE: She carries a red handbag...  
LUPIN: We don't need to hear it. As long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when I open that wardrobe, here's what I want 
you to do... Excuse me... (whispers)Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.  
LUPIN: Can you do that? Yes. Wand at the ready. One. Two. Three. Think, Neville. Think!  
NEVILLE: Riddikulus!  
OTHERS: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  
LUPIN: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay! To the back, Neville. Everyone form a line. 
Form a line. I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most, and turn it into something funny. Next! Ron! 
Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave!  
RON: Ooh..  
LUPIN: Wand at the ready, Ron. Wand at the ready!  
RON: Riddikulus!  
OTHERS: Ha, ha, ha, ha!

---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - outside - daytime  
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Now, remember! These visits to Hogsmeade Village are a privilege. Should your behavior 
reflect poorly on the school in any way, that privilege shall not be extended again. No permission form signed, no visiting 
the Village. That's the rule, Potter.  
FILCH: Those with permission follow me. Those without, stay put.  
HARRY: But Professor, I thought if you signed it, then I could go-  PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: I can't. Only a parent or guardian can sign. Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. 
I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word.  
HARRY: Forget about it guys. See you later.  
---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Wooden bridge - daytime  
HARRY: Professor, can I ask you something?  
LUPIN: You want to know why I stopped you facing that Boggart, yes? I would've thought it'd be obvious. I assumed    it 
would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.  
HARRY: I did think of Voldemort... at first. But then, I remembered that night on the train... and the dementor...  
LUPIN: Well, I'm very impressed. That suggests that what you fear the most is fear itself. This is very wise.  
HARRY: Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman. Screaming.  
LUPIN: Well, dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. Our pain becomes their power.  
HARRY: I think it was my mother. The night she was murdered.  
LUPIN: You know, the very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. 
They're your mother Lily's. Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not 
only was she a singularly gifted witch, she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in 
others, even -- and perhaps, most especially... when that person couldn't see it in themselves... And your father, James, 
on the other hand, he ah, heh- He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to 
you. You're more like them than you know, Harry. In time you'll come to see just how much.

OTHER: Come back here!  
DUMBLEDORE: Keep moving. Dear lady, who did this to you?  
FAT LADY: Eyes like the devil, he's got. And a soul as dark as his name. It's him, Headmaster. The one they all talk 
about. He's here, somewhere in the castle! Sirius Black! Aaah-hoo-hoo!

DUMBLEDORE: Very good.  
SNAPE: I've done the dungeons, Headmaster. No sign of Black. Nor anywhere else in the castle.  
DUMBLEDORE: Thank you. I didn't really expect him to linger.  
SNAPE: Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts castle on one's own, completely undetected...  
DUMBLEDORE: Quite remarkable, yes.  
SNAPE: Any theories about how he might have managed it?  
DUMBLEDORE: Many, each as unlikely as the next.  
SNAPE: You may recall that prior to the start of term, I did express concerns about your appointment of Professor-  
DUMBLEDORE: Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it. No, I'm quite convinced the 
castle is safe. And I'm more than willing to send the students back to their Houses.  
SNAPE: What about Potter? Should he be warned?

at the present time. Turn to page three hundred and ninety-four!  
RON: 'Werewolves?'  
HERMIONE: But, sir, we've just begun learning about Red Caps and Hinkypunks. We're not meant to start nocturnal 
beasts for weeks-  
SNAPE: Quiet!  
RON: When did she come in? Did you see her come in?  
SNAPE: Now. Which of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?  
SNAPE: No one? How disappointing.  
HERMIONE: Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each 
full moon when he transforms he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path. 
Furthermore, the werewolf only responds only to the call of its own kind –  
DRACO: Owooo!  
SNAPE: Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Are you 
incapable of restraining yourself, or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?  
RON: He's got a point, you know.  
SNAPE: Five    points from Gryffindor! As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk by Monday morning,    two 
rolls of parchment on the    werewolf, with particular emphasis on recognizing it.  
HARRY: But, sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow.  
SNAPE: Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter. Loss of limb will not excuse you. Page three hundred and ninetyfour.  ---------- Scene 15: Grim defeat.  
SNAPE: The term 'werewolf' is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word 'wer', which means 'man', and 'wolf'. 'Werewolf', 
'man-wolf.' There are several ways to become a werewolf. They include being given the power of shape- shifting, being 
bitten by a werewolf, or...

LUPIN: Listen, the dementors are amongst the foulest creatures to walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, 
every happy memory, until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. You are not weak, 
Harry. The dementors affect you, most of all, because there are true horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can 
scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be ashamed of.  
HARRY: I'm scared, Professor.  
LUPIN: Well, I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.  
HARRY: I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me. You made that dementor on the train go away...  
LUPIN: There was only one that night...  
HARRY: But you made it go away.

you, huh, perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays. For now, I need to rest.

finger- nothing else.

Level.  
HARRY: I'm sure.  
LUPIN: Well, everything is prepared. Now, the spell I'm going to try to teach you is called the Patronus Charm. Did you 
ever hear of it? No? Well... a Patronus is a kind of positive force, and for the wizard who can conjure one, it works 
something like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. But in order for it to work, you need think of a 
memory. And not just any memory, a    very happy memory. A very powerful memory. Can you do this? Yes. Very well. 
Close your eyes... concentrate... explore your past... Do you have a memory? Allow it to fill you up... Lose yourself within 
it... Then speak the incantation:    Expecto Patronum.

HARRY: That's one nasty dementor.  
LUPIN: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart. The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse. 
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking? Which memory did you choose?  
HARRY: The first time I rode a broom.  
LUPIN: Well, that's not good enough. Not nearly good enough.  
HARRY: There's another. It's not happy, exactly. Well, it is. It's the happiest I've ever felt. Uh, but it's complicated.

HARRY: I was thinking of him. And Mum. Seeing their faces. They were talking to me. Just talking. That's the memory I 
chose. I don't even know if it's real... But it's the best I have.

HERMIONE: Rubbish!  
RON: Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurkin' about. And Scabbers is gone!

HERMIONE: Didn't.  ---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Black Lake - shoreline - daytime  
HERMIONE: How'd it go, Hagrid? At the hearing?  
HAGRID: Well, first off, the committee members took turns talkin' abou' why we were there. And then I got up an' did my 
piece - said how Buckbeak was a good Hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then Lucius Malfoy got up an', well 
you can imagine, he said "Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill ya as soon as look at ya."  
HERMIONE: And then?  
HAGRID: An' then he asked for the worst, he did, ol' Lucius.  
RON: They're not sacking you!  
HAGRID: No, I'm not sacked. Buckbeak's been sentenced ter death!

HARRY: Mischief managed! Nox!  
SNAPE: Potter. What're you doing wandering the corridors at night?  
HARRY: I was sleepwalking...  
SNAPE: How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant.    Strutting about 
the castle-  
HARRY: My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.  
SNAPE: Turn out your pockets.    Turn out your pockets!  
SNAPE: What's this.  
HARRY: Spare bit of parchment...  
SNAPE: Really... Open it. Reveal your secrets! Read it.

SNAPE: Go on.  
HARRY: '... and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.'  
SNAPE: Why you insolent little-  
LUPIN: Professor...?  
SNAPE: Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?  
LUPIN: Harry? Are you all right?  
SNAPE: That remains to be seen. I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. 
This is supposed to be your area of expertise. Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic.  
LUPIN: I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks to me as if it is merely a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to 
read    it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall pursue any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as 
you say, my area of expertise. Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night.  
PORTRAIT #1: Are you deaf? Put that light out!  ---------- LOCATION: Hogwarts - Lupin's office - night - dark  
LUPIN: Come in. Now, I haven't the faintest idea, Harry, how this map came to be in your possession, but quite frankly, I 
am    astounded that you didn't hand it in. Did it never occur to you that this- in the hands of Sirius Black- is a map to 
you? No.  
HARRY: No, sir.  
LUPIN: You know, your father never set much store by the rules either. But he and your mother gave their lives to save 
yours. And gambling their sacrifice by wandering around the castle unprotected, with a killer on the loose, seems to me 
to be a pretty poor way to repay them! Now, I will not cover up for you again, Harry. Do you hear me?  
HARRY: Yes, sir.  
LUPIN: I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. And don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know.  
HARRY: Professor. Just so you know, I don't think the map always works. Earlier on, it showed someone in the castle. 
Someone I know to be dead.  
LUPIN: Oh, really? Who might that be?  
HARRY: Peter Pettigrew.  
LUPIN: That's not possible.  
HARRY: It's just what I saw... Good night, Professor.

HERMIONE: Oh, ah- do you mind me trying?  
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: Ah!  
HERMIONE: The Grim. Possibly.  
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class, I sensed that you did not
possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there. Ah, you may be young in years, but the 
heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which 
you so desperately cleave.

LUPIN: Well, well, Sirius, looking a bit ragged, aren't we? Finally the flesh reflects the madness within.  
SIRIUS: Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus? 
SIRIUS: I found him!  
LUPIN: I know.  
SIRIUS: It's him!  
LUPIN: I understand.  
SIRIUS: Let's kill him!  
HERMIONE: No! I trusted you! And all this time you've been his friend! He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing 
classes!  
LUPIN: How long have you known?  
HERMIONE: Since Professor Snape set the essay.  
LUPIN: Well, well, well, Hermione, you really are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.  
SIRIUS: Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him!  
LUPIN: Wait— 
SIRIUS: I did my waiting! Twelve years of it! In Azkaban!  
LUPIN: Very well. Kill him! But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why.  
HARRY: I know why. You betrayed my parents! You're the reason they're dead.  
LUPIN: No, Harry, it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents, but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I 
believed to be dead.  
HARRY: Who was it then?  SIRIUS: Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room! Right now! Come out, come out, Peter. Come out, come out and play...  
SNAPE: Expelliarmus! Ah, vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.  
LUPIN: Severus-  
SNAPE: I told Dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle. And now, here's the proof.  
SIRIUS: Brilliant, Snape! Once again you've put your keen and penetrating mind to the task and, as usual, come to the 
wrong conclusion. Now, if you'll excuse us, Remus and I have some unfinished business to attend to.  
SNAPE: Give me a reason. I beg you!  
LUPIN: Severus, don't be a fool!  
SIRIUS: He can't help it. It's habit by now.  
LUPIN: Sirius, be quiet!  
SIRIUS: Be quiet, yourself, Remus!  
SNAPE: Listen to you two. Quarreling like an old married couple.  
SIRIUS: Why don't you just run along and play with your chemistry set?  
SNAPE: I could do it, you know. But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you. Do I detect a flicker of fear? 
Oh, yes. A dementor's kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like to endure. It's said to be nearly unbearable to 
witness, but I'll do my best.  
LUPIN: Severus, please-  
SNAPE: After you.  
HARRY: Expelliarmus!

HERMIONE: You attacked a teacher!  
HARRY: Tell me about Peter Pettigrew.  
LUPIN: He was at school with us. We thought he was our friend.  
HARRY: No. Pettigrew's dead. He killed him!  
LUPIN: No he didn't! I thought so, too, until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the Map!  
HARRY: The Map was lying then- S 
SIRIUS: The Map never lies! Pettigrew's alive, and he's right there!  
RON: M- me? He's mental!  
SIRIUS: Not you, y-. Your rat!  
RON: Scabbers has been in my family for ye-  
SIRIUS: Twelve years. A curiously long life for a common garden rat. He's missing a toe, isn't he?  
RON: So what?  
HARRY: All they could find of Pettigrew was his-  
SIRIUS: -finger! The dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead. And then he transformed into a rat.  
HARRY: Show me. Give it to him, Ron.  
RON: What are you going to do to him? Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing? Scabbers!  
PETTIGREW: Aaaah! R- Remus... S- Sirius... My old friends! H- Harry! Look at you! Y- you look just like your father. 
Like James. We were the best of friends, he and I-  
SIRIUS: How dare you speak to Harry!    How dare you talk about James in front of him!  
LUPIN: You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?!  
PETTIGREW: I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord, you have no idea the weapons he possesses! Ask yourself, Sirius, what 
you would have done? What would you have done?  SIRIUS: I would have died! I would have died rather than betray my friends! 
PETTIGREW: Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed! Your dad- Your dad would have spared me! He would 
have shown me mercy!  
LUPIN: You should have realized, Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would.    Together!  
HARRY: No!  
LUPIN: Harry, this man is...  
HARRY: I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle.  
PETTIGREW: Bless you, boy! Bless you-

RON: A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!  
SIRIUS: Well, I was going for the rat. Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog. In fact, more than once James 
suggested that I make the change permanent. The tail I could live with, but the fleas, they're murder.

truth dies with him. Alive... you're free.

HERMIONE: No. It's worse. They're going to suck out his soul. Headmaster! You've got to stop them! They've got the 
wrong man!  
HARRY: It's true, sir. Sirius is innocent-  
RON: It's Scabbers who did it!  
DUMBLEDORE: Scabbers...?  
RON: He's my rat, sir. He's not really a rat. Well, he was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat- but then they gave him an 
owl, and I got-  
HERMIONE: The point is... we know the truth. Please, believe us.  
DUMBLEDORE: I do, Miss Granger. But I'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen year-old wizards will convince few 
others. A child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. (bong, bong, 
bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong)  
DUMBLEDORE: A mysterious thing, time. Powerful. And, when meddled with... dangerous. Sirius Black is    in the 
topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would do well, I feel, 
to return before this last chime. If not... the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight, more than 
one innocent life may be spared. Three turns should do it, I think. Oh, by the way, when in doubt, I find retracing my 
steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck.

CORNELIUS FUDGE: (past) "The executioner shall dispatch the condemned..."

HARRY: Get off! Get away! Get off!  
DUMBLEDORE: (past) Minister, do you really want to cut off the head of the hippogriff?  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: (past) No, I do not.  
HARRY: C'mon, Buckbeak. Come on...  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: (past) 'As witnessed below.' Sign, just here... You sign here,    Hagrid. "The executioner, acting 
on behalf of the Committee..." Very well, gentlemen. Shall we step outside...  
DUMBLEDORE: (past) Ah, ah, Minister. I really think I should sign as well...  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: (past) Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be a good thing if you...  
HARRY: Okay, Buckbeak. Come on quickly. Come with us, now. Come on!  
HERMIONE: Keep trying. Come on! Quickly!  
HARRY: Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

DUMBLEDORE: (past) Here we are Minister, follow me... now look there, see...  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: (past) Where?  
DUMBLEDORE: (past) Look, beyond the rocks.  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: (past) What am I supposed to see?  
DUMBLEDORE: (past) Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was Headmaster...  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: (past) Oh, yes, indeed, indeed.  
DUMBLEDORE: (past) And all the strawberries, you see...  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: (past) Strawberries, I see no strawberries.

CORNELIUS FUDGE: (past) Where?  
DUMBLEDORE: (past) Over there. Look.  HERMIONE: This way!  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: (past) Well, let's get this over with, please.  
DUMBLEDRE: (past) All right.  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: (past) But, where is it?    I just saw the beast, just now - not a moment ago!  
DUMBLEDORE: (past) How extraordinary!  
HAGRID: (past) Buckbeak?  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: (past) Oh, come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him. Hagrid?  
HAGRID: (past) Professor, I didn't!  
DUMBLEDORE: (past) I don't think the Minister's suggesting that you had anything to do with this, Hagrid. After all, how 
could you? Well, you've been with us all the time.  
HAGRID:(past) Well- right!  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: (past) Well, well... We must search the grounds-  
DUMBLEDORE: (past) Well, search the skies if you must, Minister. Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea. Or... a large 
brandy. Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. Thank you.  
HAGRID: (past) You'll find no small glasses in this house, Professor, heh, heh.

HERMIONE: Yeah?  
HARRY: Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius... I did see someone... that someone made the dementors go 
away...  
HERMIONE: With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore. According to him, only a really powerful wizard could 
have conjured it.  
HARRY: It was my dad. It was my dad who conjured the Patronus.  
HERMIONE: But, Harry, your dad's...  
HARRY: Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw.  
HERMIONE: Here we come.  
HARRY: You see Sirius talking to me there?

HERMIONE: That's great.  
HARRY: When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursley's. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the 
country. Someplace you can see the sky. I think he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.

HARRY: But, you're innocent.  
SIRIUS: And you know it. And for now, that'll do.  
HERMIONE: Down, Buckbeak.  SIRIUS: I expect you're tired of hearing this... but you look so like your father. Except your eyes... you have-  
HARRY: My mother's eyes.
SIRIUS: It's cruel that I got to spend so much time with James and Lily, and you so little... But know this- the ones that 
love us never really leave us, and you can always find them... in here.

HARRY: Resigned? Why?  
LUPIN: Well, it seems that somebody let    slip the nature of my condition. This time tomorrow, the owls will start 
arriving and parents will not want a, ah- well, someone like me- teaching their children. 
HARRY: But Dumbledore-  
LUPIN: Dumbledore has already risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like me are,... well... let's just say that I'm 
used to it by now. Why do you look so miserable, Harry?  
HARRY: None of it made any difference. Pettigrew escaped.  
LUPIN: Didn't make any difference? Harry, it made all the difference in the world. You helped uncover the truth. 
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. It made a great deal of difference. If I am proud of anything, it is of 
how much you have learned this year. Now, since I am no longer your teacher,    I feel no guilt whatsoever about 
giving this back to you. So now, I'll say good-bye, Harry. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Until then... mischief

(whispering) what is it? 
FILCH: (whispering) ...Beauxbatons... 
DUMBLEDORE: (whispering) They have to wait. 
DUMBLEDORE: So, Hogwarts has been chosen to host a legendary event: the Triwizard Tournament. Now, for those of 
you who do not know, the Triwizard Tournament brings together three    schools for a series of magical contests. 
From each school, a single student is selected to compete. Now let me be clear: if chosen, you stand alone. And trust me 
when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now, please join me in welcoming the 
lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and their Headmistress, Madame Maxime.

wins the Triwizard Tournament. But to do this, that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks. 
FRED AND GEORGE: Wicked. 
DUMBLEDORE: For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the Head of 
the Department of International Magical Cooperation,    Mr. Bartemius Crouch. 
STUDENTS: Ahh! Eeeh! 
RON: Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody. 
HERMIONE: Alastor Moody? The Auror? 
DEAN THOMAS: Auror? 
RON: Dark wizard catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full, thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter, though, 
these days. 
DUMBLEDORE: Ah, my dear old friend, thanks for coming. 
MAD-EYE MOODY: Stupid ceiling. 
DUMBLEDORE: Ha, ha. 
SEAMUS: What's that he's drinkin’, do you suppose? 
HARRY: I dunno, but I don't think it's pumpkin juice. 
MR. CROUCH: After due consideration, the Ministry has concluded that, for their own safety, no student under the age of 
seventeen should be allowed to put forth their name for the Triwizard Tournament. This decision is final. 
FRED AND GEORGE: That's rubbish!  GEORGE: That’s rubbish! You don't know what you're doing! 
OTHERS: Booo! 
DUMBLEDORE: Silence!  
HERMIONE: We’ll not talk about that, then. 
DUMBLEDORE: The Goblet of Fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the Tournament, merely write their name    
upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly; if chosen 
there's no turning back. As from this moment, the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

Arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many Unforgivable Curses there are? 
HERMIONE: Three, sir. 
MAD-EYE MOODY: And they are so named? 
HERMIONE: Because they are unforgivable. Use any one of them will... 
MAD-EYE MOODY: Will earn you a one-way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now the Ministry says you're too young to see 
what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against! You need to be prepared!    You need 
to find another place to put your chewing gum besides the underside of your desk, Mr. Finnigan! 
SEAMUS: Aw, no way! The old codger can see out the back of his head! 
MAD-EYE MOODY: I’m here to call the class rules! So, which curse shall we see first? Weasley!

RON: Well, my- my dad did tell me about one... 
MAD-EYE MOODY: Huh?  
RON: The Imperious Curse.

MAD-EYE MOODY: What are you laughing at? 
DRACO: Ahh! Get it off me!  
HARRY: Aha, ha, ha! 
MAD-EYE MOODY: Ah-ha, ha, ha! Talented, isn't she? What shall I have her do next? Jump out    the window? Drown
herself? Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only did You-Know-Whose bidding under the influence of 
the Imperious Curse. But, here's the rub: how do we sort out the liars? Another... another... Ah, ha... come on. 
Longbottom, is it? Up. Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for Herbology. 
NEVILLE: There- there's the um... The Cruciatus Curse. 
MAD-EYE MOODY: Correct! Correct! Come, come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse. Crucio! 
HERMIONE: Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him? Stop it! 
MAD-EYE MOODY: Ah. Um, huh. Perhaps you could give us the last Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.  
MAD-EYE MOODY: No? Avada Kedavra!    The killing curse. Only one    person is known to have survived it. And 
he's sitting    in this room.

RON: Brilliant, isn't he! Completely demented, of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with. But he's really been 
there, you know. He’s looked evil in the eye. 
HERMIONE: There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom... I mean, did you see 
Neville's face? 
HERMIONE: Neville? 
MAD-EYE MOODY: Son, you alright?

FRED: Cooked it up just this morning.  
HERMIONE: It's not going to work. 
FRED: Oh, yeah?  
GEORGE: And why's that, Granger? 
HERMIONE: You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself. 
FRED: So? 
HERMIONE: So, a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted as an aging 
potion. 
FRED: Ah, but that's why it's so brilliant.  
GEORGE: Because it’s so pathetically dimwitted.

DUMBLEDORE: The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory. 
DUMBLEDORE: Excellent!    We now have our three champions! But in the end, only one will go down in history. Only 
one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory, the Triwizard Cup!

MADAME MAXIME: I protest! I protest! 
DUMBLEDORE: Harry! Did you put your name in that Goblet of Fire   ? 
HARRY: No, sir. 
DUMBLEDORE: Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you? 
HARRY: No, sir. 
DUMBLEDORE: You're absolutely sure? 
HARRY: Yes, sir. Yes, sir! 
MADAME MAXIME: But of course, he is lying. 
MAD-EYE MOODY: The hell he is. The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object. Only an 
exceptionally powerful Confundus charm could have hoodwinked it - magic way beyond the talents of a Fourth Year!
KARKAROFF: You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye. 
MAD-EYE MOODY: It was once my job to think as Dark wizards do, Karkaroff. Perhaps you    remember? 
DUMBLEDORE: That doesn't help, Alastor. I leave this to you, Barty. MR. CROUCH: The rules are absolute. The Goblet of Fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr. Potter has no 
choice. He is, as of tonight, a Triwizard champion.

DUMBLEDORE: You heard Barty. The rules are clear. 
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Well, the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accommodate the 
Ministry? 
SNAPE: Master, I, too, find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence. However, if we are to truly discover the meaning of 
these events, perhaps we should, for the time being, let them unfold. 
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: What? Do nothing? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat. 
DUMBLEDORE: I agree... with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

HARRY: I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron. Okay? You're being stupid. 
RON: Yeah, that's me. Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's stupid friend.

that, don't you? It's you we don't know. You're the juicy news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? What 
mysteries do the muscles mask? Does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick? Me, 
myself and I want to know, not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall we start with 
the youngest? Lovely.

RITA SKEETER: You should feel right at home, then. Don't mind    if I use a Quick Quotes Quill, do you? 
HARRY: Oh- um, no. 
RITA SKEETER: So tell me Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of twelve... 
HARRY: I'm fourteen. 
RITA SKEETER: ...about to compete against three students, not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself, but 
who have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned? 
HARRY: Um, I- I dunno. I haven't really...thought about it. 
RITA SKEETER: Just ignore the Quill. But then of course, you're no ordinary boy of twelve, are you? 
HARRY: Fourteen. 
RITA SKEETER: The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to    enter
such a dangerous tournament? 
HARRY: Ah, no, I- I didn't enter. 
RITA SKEETER: Ah- Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel, Harry. Ah, ha. Scratch that last. Speaking of your 
parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? Proud? Or concerned that your attitude shows, at best, a 
pathological need for attention; at worst, a psychotic death wish?

SIRIUS (IN FIRE): Psst...psst. Ahh... 
HARRY: Sirius?! How... 
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): I don't have much time, Harry, so let me get straight to it. Did you, or did you not, put your name into 
the Goblet of Fire? 
HARRY: No! 
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, 
but who was the third man in the room? 
HARRY: I dunno. 
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): You didn't hear a name? 
HARRY: No. Umm... Voldemort was giving him a job to do, something important. 
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): And what was that? 
HARRY: He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. Well, I- I mean, it was only a dream, 
right? 
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): Yes. It's just a dream. Look, Harry, the Death Eaters at the World Cup, your name rising from that 
Goblet, these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more. 
HARRY: What are you saying? 
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff,    he was a Death Eater. And no one, no one 
stops being a Death Eater. Then there's Barty Crouch- heart of stone- sent his own son to Azkaban. 
HARRY: Do you think one of them put my name in the Goblet? 
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): I haven't a clue who put your name in that Goblet, Harry, but whoever did is no friend to you. People 
die in this tournament. 
HARRY: I'm not ready for this, Sirius. 
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): You don't have a choice. 
HARRY: Someone's coming! 
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): Keep your friends close, Harry! 
RON: Who were you talking to?

HERMIONE: Look, we've already been through enough people. Why don't you just go and talk to him yourself? Ughh.

MAD-EYE MOODY: Sit. Listen to me, Potter. Your pal Diggory, by your age he could turn a whistle into a watch and have 
it sing you the time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with 
sawdust, but Karkaroff's is not. They'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come 
on, Potter. What are your strengths?

Yule Ball is first and foremost... a dance.

MADAME MAXIME: Oh? 
HAGRID: No, not the maternal sort, her; broke my dad's heart, though. Do you know he was a tiny little feller, my 
dad? I could pick him up at the age of six with one hand and put him up on    the dresser. HAGRID AND MADMAE MAXIME: Ha, ha, ha, ha! 
HAGRID: You laughed so hard at that... And then he died,    just when I started school. An’ so I sort o’ had to make 
me own way, as it were. But enough of me, what about you?

RON (READING NOTE FROM FRED): ‘Get a move on or all the good ones will have gone’

ANGELINA JOHNSON: To the ball? Sure! 
RON: Well, Hermione, you're a girl. 
HERMIONE: Oh, well spotted. 
RON: Come with one of us? Ow! 
HARRY: Oh! 
RON: Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad. 
HERMIONE: I won't be going alone because, believe it or not, someone's asked me.  
HERMIONE: And I said ‘yes.’ 
RON: Bloody hell. She’s lying, right? 
HARRY: If you say so. 
RON: Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room,    we'll both

HERMIONE: No, of course. 
HERMIONE: She said yes? 
HARRY: Don't be silly.

GINNY: Actually, he sort of screamed at her. It was a bit frightening.

‘international magical cooperation’...to make    friends.

HERMIONE: I wouldn't know. We don't actually talk about the Tournament. Actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's 
more of a physical being. Ah- I just mean, he's not particularly loquacious.  
HARRY: Uh-hum. 
HERMIONE: Mostly, he watches me study. It's a bit annoying, actually. You are trying to figure this egg out, aren't you? 
HARRY: What's that supposed to mean? 
HERMIONE: It just means these tasks are designed to test you, in the most brutal way; they're almost cruel. And um... I'm 
scared for you. You got by the dragons mostly on nerve. I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.

there's a wizard i- in Nepal who’s growing gravity-resistant trees?

such time, you remain in the eyes of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater. Do you accept these terms? 
KARKAROFF: I do, sir. 
MR. CROUCH: What do you wish to present?

MR. CROUCH: If that is all the witness has to offer... 
KARKAROFF: No! No! No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy. 
MR. CROUCH: Augustus Rookwood? Of the Department of Mysteries? 
KARKAROFF: Ya, ya, the    same. He passed information to You-Know-Who from inside the Ministry itself. 
MR. CROUCH: Very well, Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime, you will be returned to Azkaban. 
KARKAROFF: No! Wait! Wait, please, please! I have more. What about Snape, Severus Snape? 
DUMBLEDORE: As the counsel is very much aware I have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed 
a Death Eater, and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall    turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today, he's no 
more a Death Eater than I am.
KARKAROFF: It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord. 
MR. CROUCH: Silence! Unless the witness possesses any genuine name of consequence, this session is now 
concluded.

searched and searched for something, some small detail, something I might have overlooked, something that would 
explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer, it slips away. It's maddening.

overwhelming. Why do you ask? 
HARRY: It's just that I- I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream, I was in a house, and 
Voldemort was there- only he wasn't quite human- and Wormtail was there, too, and Mr. Crouch's son. 
DUMBLEDORE: Have there been others like this dream? 
HARRY: Yes, always the same one. Sir... these dreams- what I see- you don't think it's actually happening, do you?

LOCATION: Hogwarts – Quidditch Pitch – Maze entrance - daytime  
CROWD: (Cheering) Yeah! 
DUMBLEDORE: (Amplified) Silence! Earlier today, Professor Moody placed the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze. Only 
he knows its exact position. Now, as Mr. Diggory...  
CROWD: Yeah! 
DUMBLEDORE: (Amplified) ...and Mr. Potter...  
CROWD: Yeah! 
DUMBLEDORE: (Amplified) ...are tied for first position, they will be the first to enter the maze, followed by Mr. Krum...  
CROWD: Yeah! 
KARKAROFF: Come on! Krum, Krum, Krum... 
DUMBLEDORE: (Amplified)...and Miss Delacour. 
CROWD: Yeah! 
DUMBLEDORE: (Amplified) The first person to touch the Cup will be the winner!  
CROWD: Yeah! 
DUMBLEDORE: (Amplified) I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter. If, at any point, should a contestant should 
wish to withdraw from the task, he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round... 
quickly! 
DUMBLEDORE: In the maze you'll find no dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead, you'll face something even more 
challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh, find the Cup, if you can, but be very wary. You could just lose 
yourselves along the way. 
DUMBLEDORE: Champions! Prepare yourselves. 
CROWD: Yeah! 
AMOS DIGGORY: Cedric, good luck! Good boy! 
DUMBLEDORE: On the count of three... One...

KRUM: Lagrovari! 
CEDRIC: Expelliarmus! 
HARRY: No, don’t- stop! He's bewitched, Cedric.  
CEDRIC: Get off me! 
HARRY: He's bewitched! 
HARRY: Yes! 
CEDRIC: Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry! 
HARRY: Reducto! 
CEDRIC: Th- thanks. 
HARRY: No problem. 
CEDRIC: You know, for a moment there, I thought y- you were gonna let it get me.  
HARRY: For a moment, so did I. 
CEDRIC: Some game, huh? 
HARRY: Some game. 
CEDRIC: Go!

CEDRIC: You OK? 
HARRY: Yeah, you? 
CEDRIC: Where are we? 
HARRY: I've been here before! 
CEDRIC: It's a Portkey. Harry, the cup is a Portkey. 
HARRY: I've been here before, in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup. Now! 
CEDRIC: What are you talking about? 
HARRY: Ah! Arhh! Oh! 
CEDRIC: Harry, what is it? 
HARRY: Get back to the Cup! CEDRIC: Who are you? What do you want? 
VOLDEMORT: Kill the spare.
WORMTAIL: Avada Kedavra! 
HARRY: No! Cedric! Ah! Ah! Ah! 
VOLDEMORT: Do it, now! 
WORMTAIL: Bone of the father, unwillingly given.  
WORMTAIL: Flesh of the servant, willingly sacrificed.  
WORMTAIL: Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken. 
HARRY: Ah! Arhh! 
WORMTAIL: The Dark Lord shall rise again.  
HARRY: Arhh! Ahh! Oh! Ah! Ah!

Scene 23: The Death Eaters.
VOLDEMORT: Ah-hah. My wand, Wormtail. 
VOLDEMORT: Hold out your arm. 
WORMTAIL: Master! Thank you, Master.
VOLDEMORT: The other arm, Wormtail. 
VOLDEMORT: Welcome, my friends. Thirteen years it's been, and yet here you stand before me as though it were
only yesterday. I confess myself... disappointed. Not one of you tried to find me. Crabbe!    Macnair!    Goyle! Not 
even you... Lucius.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: My Lord,    had I detected any sign, or a whisper, of your whereabouts... 
VOLDEMORT: There were signs, my slippery friend, and more than whispers.  
LUCIUS MALFOY: I assure you, my Lord, I have never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present 
each day since your absence, ...that was my true mask. 
WORMTAIL: I returned. 
VOLDEMORT: Out of fear,    not    loyalty. Still, you have proved yourself useful these past few months, Wormtail. 
WORMTAIL: Oh! Thank you, Master. Thank you!
VOLDEMORT: Oh, tsk, tsk, tsk. Such a handsome boy.  
HARRY: Don't touch him! 
VOLDEMORT: Harry! Oh, I'd almost forgotten you were here, standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you, but 
word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. ‘The boy who lived.’ How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I 
reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was love. You 
see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son, she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch 
him. It was old magic, something I should have foreseen. But, no matter, no matter. Things have changed. I can touch
you... now!  
HARRY: Oh! Ow! Arh! Ahh! Ahhh! Ah, ah, ahhhhh! 
VOLDEMORT: Ahh! Ha! Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do, eh, Harry?  
----------
Scene 26: Priori Incantatem.
VOLDEMORT: Pick up your wand, Potter. I said, ‘Pick it up.’ Get up! Get up! You've been taught how to duel, I 
presume, yes? First, we bow to each other. Come on now, Harry, the niceties must be observed. Dumbledore
wouldn’t want you to forget your manners now, would he? I said, ‘Bow!’...  
HARRY: Ohh! 
VOLDEMORT: That's better. And, now... Crucio!  
HARRY: Ahhh! 
VOLDEMORT: Crucio! Atta boy, Harry. Your parents would be proud; especially your filthy, Muggle mother.  
HARRY: Expelliam...  Ahh! 
VOLDEMORT: I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter. I'm going to destroy you. After tonight, no one will ever again question 
my powers. After tonight, if they speak of you, they'll speak only of how you...  
begged for death. And I, being a merciful Lord, obliged. Get up! 
HARRY: Ahh! Oh! 
VOLDEMORT: Don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter. I want you to look at me when I kill you. I want to see the 
lights leave your eyes... 
HARRY: Have it your way. Expelliarmus! 
VOLDEMORT: Avada Kedavra!    Do nothing! He is mine to finish... He's mine! 
JAMES POTTER: Harry, when the connection is broken,    you must get to the Portkey. We can ring him for a 
moment to give you time, but only a moment. Do you understand?
CEDRIC: Harry, take my body back, will you? Take my body back to my father. 
LILY POTTER: Let go. Sweetheart, you're ready. Let go! Let gooo! 
HARRY: Accio! 
VOLDEMORT: Arrgh! No!

CORNELIUS FUDGE: For god’s sake, Dumbledore, what’s happened? 
HARRY: He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back! Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not 
there! 
DUMBLEDORE: It's alright, Harry, it's alright. He's home. You both are. 
FUDGE: Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be moved, Dumbledore, there are... 
too many people.

MAD-EYE MOODY: Are you alright, Potter? 
HARRY: (nods) 
MAD-EYE MOODY: Does it hurt... that? 
HARRY: Not so much now. 
MAD-EYE MOODY: Perhaps I'd better take a look at it. 
HARRY: The cup was a Portkey. Someone had bewitched it. 
MAD-EYE MOODY: What was it like? What was he like? 
HARRY: Who? 
MAD-EYE MOODY: The Dark Lord.  
HARRY: Ah! 
MAD-EYE MOODY: What was it like, to stand in his presence? 
HARRY: I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams, into one of my nightmares.  
MAD-EYE MOODY: Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others? 
HARRY: Um...uh... I- I don't... think I said anything about a graveyard, Professor. 
MAD-EYE MOODY: Marvelous creatures, dragons, aren't they? Do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into 
the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if I 
hadn't have told him first, myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom, the witless wonder, could have provided you with 
gillyweed if I hadn't have given him the book that led him straight to it? Huh? Eh? 
HARRY: It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the Goblet of Fire. You bewitched Krum. But...  
MAD-EYE MOODY: ‘But, boo-hoo’. You won because I made it so, Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight 
because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the Dark 
Lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have, once and for all, silenced the great Harry Potter. 
(Bam) 
DUMBLEDORE: Expelliarmus! 
DUMBLEDORE: Severus... 
DUMBLEDORE: Do you know who I am?

DUMBLEDORE: Harry get away from there! 
DUMBLEDORE: You alright, Alastor? 
ALASTOR: I'm sorry, Albus. 
HARRY: That's Moody, but then who's...? 
SNAPE: Polyjuice potion. 
DUMBLEDORE: Now we know who's been stealing from your stores, Severus. 
DUMBLEDORE: We'll get you up in a minute. 
BARTY CROUCH JUNIOR: Arhh! Arrrh! Ugh! 
DUMBLEDORE: Barty Crouch Junior. 
BARTY CROUCH JUNIOR: I'll show you mine, if you show me yours. 
DUMBLEDORE: Your arm, Harry. 
BARTY CROUCH JUNIOR: You know what this means, don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned. 
HARRY: I’m sorry, sir. I couldn’t help it.  
DUMBLEDORE: Send an owl to Azkaban. I think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.  
BARTY CROUCH JUNIOR: I'll be welcomed back like a hero. 
DUMBLEDORE: Perhaps. Personally, I've never had much time for heroes.

LOCATION: Hogwarts – Great Hall - daytime 
DUMBLEDORE: Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was, as you all know, exceptionally hard 
working, infinitely fair-minded, and, most importantly, a fierce, fierce friend. Now, I think, therefore, you have the right    
to know exactly how he died. You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered... by Lord Voldemort. The Ministry of Magic 
does not wish me to tell you this. But, not to do so, I think, would be an insult to his memory. Now, the pain we all feel 
at this dreadful loss reminds me, and reminds us, that while we may come from different  
places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events, the bonds of friendship we’ve 
made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that, and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain. You 
remember that, and we'll celebrate a boy who was kind, and honest, and brave, and true, right to the very end. 
---------- 
LOCATION: Hogwarts – Gryffindor boys’ dormitory - daytime 
DUMBLEDORE: Huh... I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year; by accident, of course. I put you in 
terrible danger this year, Harry. I'm sorry. 
HARRY: Professor, when I was in the graveyard, there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of 
connected. 
DUMBLEDORE: Priori Incantatem... You saw your parents that night, didn't you? They reappeared.  
DUMBLEDORE: No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry. I trust you know that. Dark and difficult times lie ahead. Soon 
we must all face the choice between what is right, and what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're 
not alone.

DUDLEY: This one deserved it. 
FRIENDS: Yeah. 
HARRY: Five against one; very brave.

FRIENDS: Heh, heh. Ha, ha, ha! 
DUDLEY: “Don’t kill Cedric!”    Who’s Cedric, your boyfriend?  “He’s going to kill me, Mom!” Where is your mom? 
Where is your mom, Potter? She dead? Is she dead!? Is she dead, Pot-

MRS. FIGG: Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you. 
HARRY: Dumbledore? You know Dumbledore? 
---------- 
LOCATION: Privet Drive, Little Whinging, street 
MRS. FIGG: Uh-huh. After You-Know-Who killed that poor Diggory boy last year, did you expect him to let you go

UNCLE VERNON: Happy, are we, now? Eh? You’ve finally done it. You’ve finally driven him loopy. J-j-just look at him, 
Petunia! Our boy has gone yumpy. I’ve reached my limit, do you hear? This is the last I’m going to take of you and your 
nonsense! 
MoM LETTER: “Dear Mr. Potter, the Ministry has received intelligence that at six twenty-three this evening you 
performed the Patronus Charm    in the presence of a Muggle. As a clear violation of the Decree for the Reasonable

SHAKLEBOLT: Dumbledore has persuaded the Minister to suspend your expulsion pending a formal hearing. 
HARRY: A hearing? 
SHAKLEBOLT: Uh, huh. 
TONKS: Don’t worry, Harry. We’ll explain when we get back to Headquarters.

RON: Let the man breathe, Hermione. 
HERMIONE: And the hearing at the Ministry. It’s just outrageous! I’ve looked it all up, and they just can’t expel you. 
It’s completely unfair.  
RON: Yeah. 
HARRY: There’s a lot of that going around at the moment. So what is this place? 
RON: It’s Headquarters.  
HERMIONE: Of the Order of the Phoenix.    It’s a secret society. Dumbledore formed it back when they first fought    
You-Know-Who.  
HARRY: Couldn’t have put that into a letter, I suppose. I’ve gone all summer without a scrap of news. 
RON: We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did. Only… 
HARRY: Only what?  
HERMIONE: Only Dumbledore made us promise not to tell you anything.  
HARRY: Dumbledore said that? B-but why would he want to keep me in the dark. Maybe I could help. After all, I-I’m the 
one who saw Voldemort return, I’m the one who fought him, I’m the one who saw Cedric Diggory get killed… 
FRED: Hi Harry, thought we heard your dulcet tones.

ARTHUR: It’s really very peculiar. It seems that your hearing at the ministry is to be before the entire Wizengamot. 
HARRY: I don’t understand. What has the Ministry of Magic got against me? 
MOODY: Show him. He’ll find out soon enough. 
SIRIUS: He’s been attacking Dumbledore, as well. Fudge is using all of his powers, including his influence at the Daily 
Prophet, to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned. 
HARRY: Why? 
LUPIN: The Minister thinks Dumbledore is after his job.  
HARRY: But that’s insane! No one in their right mind would believe that Dumbledore… 
LUPIN: Exactly the point – Fudge isn’t in his right mind. It’s been twisted and warped by fear. Now fear makes people do 
terrible things, Harry. Now, the last time Voldemort gained power he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear. Now 
he’s returned, and I’m afraid the Minister will do almost anything to avoid facing the terrifying truth. 
SIRIUS: We think Voldemort wants to build up his army again. Fourteen years ago he had huge numbers at his 
command – not just witches and wizards, but all manner of Dark creatures. He’s been recruiting heavily, and we’ve 
been attempting to do the same, but gathering followers isn’t the only    thing he’s interested in…
ARTHUR: Ahem… 
SIRIUS: We believe Voldemort may be after something…. 
MOODY: Sirius… 
SIRIUS: …Something he didn’t have last time… 
HARRY: You mean, like a weapon? 
MRS. WEASLEY: No. That’s enough. He’s just a boy! You say much more and you might as well induct him into the 
Order straightaway.
HARRY: Good! I want to join. If Voldemort’s raising an army, then I want to fight!

LOCATION: Ministry of Magic – court room 
CORNELIUS FUDGE: (bangs gavel three times) This is a disciplinary hearing    into the offences committed by Harry 
James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. The interrogator is Cornelius Oswald 
Fudge, Minister of - 
DUMBLEDORE:  -Witness for the Defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: You- you got our message that the time and place of the hearing had been changed, did 
you? 
DUMBLEDORE: I must have missed it, but by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. Charges? 
CORNELIUS FUDGE: The charges against the accused are as follows: that he did knowingly,    and in full 
awareness of the illegality of his actions,    produce a Patronus Charm       in the presence of a Muggle. Do you 
deny producing said Patronus? 
HARRY: No, but… 
CORNELIUS FUDGE: And are you aware that you are forbidden to use magic outside of school while under the age of 
seventeen? 
HARRY: Yes, I ju- CORNELIUS FUDGE: Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot- 
HARRY: I was only doing it because of the Dementors! 
MADAM BONES: Dementors? In Little Whinging-  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Why that’s quite clever! Muggles can’t see Dementors, can they, boy? Highly convenient… 
HARRY: I’m not lying! There were two of them, and if I hadn’t they… 
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Enough! I’m sorry to interrupt what I’m sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story, 
but since you can produce no witnesses of the event… 
DUMBLEDORE: Pardon me, Minister, but as it happens, we can… 
---------- 
LOCATION: Ministry of Magic – court room - later 
MADAM BONES: Please describe the attack. What did they look like? 
MRS. FIGG: Well, one of them was very large, and the other   rather skinny. 
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Not the boys, the Dementors. 
MRS. FIGG: Oh right, right. Well, big, cloaked, then everything went cold,    as though all of the happiness had gone 
from the world. 
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Now look here, Dementors don’t just wander    into a Muggle suburb and    happen    across a 
wizard, the- the odds are astronomical, heh, heh… 
DUMBLEDORE: I don’t think that anyone believes that the Dementors were there by coincidence, Minister.  
UMBRIDGE: Ahem… I’m sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor.    The Dementors are, after all, under the 
control of the Ministry of Magic. So silly of me. But it sounded for a    moment as though you were suggesting that 
the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy… 
DUMBLEDORE: That would be disturbing, indeed, Madam Undersecretary, which is why I am sure that the Ministry will 
be announcing a full-scale inquiry into why the two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they 
mounted an attack without authorization. Of course, there is someone who might be behind the attack… Cornelius, I 
implore you to see reason. The evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontrovertible.  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: He’s not back!  
DUMBLEDORE: In the matter of Harry Potter, the law clearly states that magic may be used before Muggles in lifethreatening situations.  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.  
DUMBLEDORE: Clearly, it has    become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of 
under-age magic!  
MADAM BONES: Those in favor of conviction… 
MADAM BONES:    Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges… 
CORNELIUS FUDGE:    Cleared of all charges…(bang)

DUMBLEDORE: Good evening, children. Now, we have    two changes in staffing this year. We are    pleased to 
welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who’ll be taking Care of Magical Creatures while Professor Hagrid is on 
temporary leave. We also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher,    Professor Dolores 
Umbridge. I’m sure you’ll all join me in wishing the Professor good luck. Now, as usual, our caretaker,    Mr. Filch,    has 
asked me    to remind you… 
UMBRIDGE: Hem, hem… hee, hee…. 
HARRY: She was at my hearing, she works for Fudge.
UMBRIDGE: Thank you, Headmaster, for those kind words of welcome.    And how lovely to see all your bright, 
happy       faces smiling up at me. I’m sure we’re all going to be very good friends. 
FRED AND GEORGE: That’s likely. 
UMBRIDGE: The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of 
vital importance.    Although each headmaster    has brought something new to    this historic school,…    progress 
for the sake of progress must be discouraged.    Let us preserve what must be preserved, perfect what can be 
perfected, and prune    practices that ought to be prohibited. Hee, hee… 
DUMBLEDORE: (clapping) 
STUDENTS: (clapping) 
DUMBLEDORE: Thank you,    Professor Umbridge, that really was most illuminating. 
RON: Illuminating? What a load of waffle. 
HARRY: What’s it mean?

SEAMUS: Me mum didn’t want me to come back this year.

SEAMUS: Let me see, uh, because of you. The Daily Prophet’s been saying a lot of thing about you, Harry, and about 
Dumbledore as well. 
HARRY: What, you mum believes them? 
SEAMUS: Well, nobody was there the night Cedric died… 
HARRY: Oh, so I guess you should just read the    Prophet, like your stupid mother,    it’ll tell you everything you want 
to know. 
SEAMUS: Don’t you dare talk about my mother like that! 
HARRY: I’ll take on anyone who calls me a liar. 
RON: What’s going on? 
SEAMUS: He’s    mad,    is what’s going on. Do you believe    the rubbish he’s coming out with about You-KnowWho?

UMBRIDGE: Good morning, children. Ordinary Wizarding Level Examinations… O.W.L., more commonly known as 
“owls”. Study hard, and you will be rewarded. Fail to do so, and the consequences may be… severe. Your previous 
instruction in this subject has been disturbingly uneven, but you will be pleased to know from now on we will be 
following a carefully constructed, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic. 
HERMIONE: There’s nothing in here about using defensive spells… 
UMBRIDGE: Using    spells? Ha, ha! Why, I can’t imagine why you would need to use    spells    in my classroom. 
RON: We’re not going to use magic? 
UMBRIDGE: You’ll be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way.
HARRY: Well, what’s the good of that? If we’re going to be attacked, it’s not going to be “risk-free”.UMBRIDGE: Students will raise their hands to speak in my class.    It is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical 
knowledge will be    sufficient to get you through your examination which, after all, is what school is all about. 
HARRY: And how is theory supposed to prepare us for what’s       out there? 
UMBRIDGE: There is nothing    out there, dear.    Who do you imagine wants to attack children, like yourselves? 
HARRY: Oh, I don’t know, maybe… Lord Voldemort?  
STUDENTS: (murmurs, chuckles) 
UMBRIDGE: Now let me make this quite plain. You have been told that a certain Dark wizard    is at large once 
again. This…is…a…lie! 
HARRY: It’s not a lie! I saw him, I fought him! 
UMBRIDGE: Detention, Mr. Potter- 
HARRY: So according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?
UMBRIDGE: Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident. 
HARRY: It was murder! Voldemort killed him – you must know that! 
UMBRIDGE: Enough! Enough. See me later, Mr. Potter, in my office. Hee, hee!

HARRY: (knock, knock)  
UMBRIDGE: Come in. Good evening, Mr. Potter.    Sit.    You’re going to be doing some lines for me today, Mr. 
Potter. No, not with your quill. You’re going to be using a rather special one of mine. Now, I want you to write “I 
must not tell lies.”  
HARRY: How many times? 
UMBRIDGE: Well, let’s say… as long as it takes for the message to sink in.
HARRY: You haven’t given me any ink. 
UMBRIDGE: Oh, you won’t need any ink. 
HARRY: Ah…uh!  Uh…ah…(hand is being cut) 
UMBRIDGE: Yes? 
HARRY: Nothing.

HERMIONE: I’ll read and correct them, that’s all.  
RON: Hermione,    you’re the most wonderful person I’ve ever met. If I’m ever rude to you again…
HERMIONE: I’ll know you’ve gone back to normal. Harry, what’s wrong with your hand?
HARRY: Nothing. 
HERMIONE: The other hand. Oh – you’ve got to tell Dumbledore! 
HARRY: No – Dumbledore’s got enough on his mind right now. Anyway, I don’t want to give Umbridge the 
satisfaction. 
RON: Bloody hell, Harry, the hag is torturing you! If the parents knew about this… 
HARRY: Yeah, well I haven’t got any of those, have I Ronald?

HARRY: What are they? 
LUNA: They’re called Thestrals. They’re quite gentle, really, but people avoid them because they’re a bit… 
HARRY: Different. But why can’t the others see them? 
LUNA: They can only be seen by people who’ve seen death. 
HARRY: So, you’ve known someone who’s died, then? 
LUNA: My mum. She was quite an extraordinary witch,    but she did like to experiment, and    one day    one of her 
spells went badly wrong.    I was nine.  
HARRY: I’m sorry.  
LUNA: Yes, it was rather horrible. I do feel very sad about it sometimes, but I’ve    got Dad. We both believe you, by 
the way, that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and you fought him, and the Ministry and the paper are conspiring 
against you and Dumbledore… 
HARRY: Thanks. Seems you’re about the only ones who do.  
LUNA: I don’t think that’s true, but I imagine that’s how he wants you to feel. 
HARRY: What do you mean? LUNA: Well, if I were You-Know-Who, I’d want you to feel cut off from everyone else, because if it’s just you alone, you’re 
not as much of a threat.

HARRY: Sirius! What are you doing here? 
SIRIUS: (in fireplace) Answering your letter. You said you were worried about Umbridge. What’s she doing, training you 
to kill half-breeds? 
HARRY:  Sirius, she’s not training us to do anything at all. 
SIRIUS: Well, I’m not surprised. The latest intelligence says that Fudge doesn’t want you trained in combat. 
RON:    Combat? What’s he think,    that we’re forming some sort of wizard army? 
SIRIUS: Well, that’s exactly what he thinks. That Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry.    
He’s becoming more paranoid    by the minute. The others wouldn’t want me telling you this, Harry, but things aren’t 
going at all well with the Order. Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn, and these disappearances are just how it started 
before. Voldemort is on the move.

Hermione, let’s go, they just think I’m some sort of freak…

LUNA: Is it true that you can produce a Patronus Charm? 
HERMIONE: Yes. I’ve seen it.

NEVILLE: And he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore’s office. 
HERMIONE: It’s true. 
RON: And third year he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once. 
HERMIONE: And last year he fought You-Know-Who in the flesh. 
HARRY: Hermione… Look, it all sounds great when you say it like that, but the truth is most of that was just luck. I 
didn’t know what I was doing half the time,    and I nearly always had help.  
HERMIONE: You’re just being modest. 
HARRY: No, Hermione, I’m not… Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. In school, if you make a mistake, you can 
just try again tomorrow, but out there…when you’re    a second away from being murdered,    or watching a friend    
die right before your eyes… you don’t know what that’s like.

HARRY: Wet. Only, she was sort of crying. 
RON: That bad at it, eh? 
HERMIONE: I’m sure Harry’s kissing was more than satisfactory. Cho spends half of her time crying these days. 
RON: You’d think a bit of snogging would cheer her up. 
HERMIONE: Don’t you understand how she must be feeling? Well….obviously she’s feeling    sad about Cedric, 
and therefore confused about liking Harry, and guilty about kissing him, conflicted because Fudge is threatening to 
sack her mom from her job at the Ministry, and frightened that she won’t do well on her O.W.L.s because she’s so worried 
about everything else.

SNAPE: Read it. Control it. Unhinge it. In the past it was often the Dark Lord’s pleasure to invade the minds of his victims, 
creating visions designed to torture them into madness. Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony, only after 
he had them literally begging for death, would he finally… kill them. Used properly, the power of Occulomency will help 
shield you from access or influence. In these lessons, I will attempt to penetrate your mind, you will attempt to resist.

KREACHER: Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass…Harry Potter, the boy who stopped the Dark Lord…friend 
of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike…if my poor mistress… 
SIRIUS: Kreacher! That’s enough of your bile. Away with you! 
KREACHER: Of course, Master. Kreacher lives to serve the Noble House of Black. 
SIRIUS: Sorry about that. He never was very pleasant, even when I was a boy. Not to me, anyway.  
HARRY: Wha- what, you- you grew up here? 
SIRIUS: This is my parents’ house. I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order- about the only useful 
thing I’ve been able to do. This is the Black family tree… my deranged cousin… I hated the    lot of them: my 
parents, with their pure-blood mania. My    mother did that after I ran away. Charming woman.  I was    sixteen. 
HARRY: Where did you go? 
SIRIUS: To your dad’s. I was always welcome at the Potter’s. I see him so much in you, Harry. You are so very much 
alike. 
HARRY: I’m not so sure. Sirius, when I was… when I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn’t just watching. I was the snake.
And afterwards, in Dumbledore’s office, there was a moment when I – I wanted to – to… this connection between me and 
Voldemort, what if the reason for it is because I am becoming more like him? I- I just feel so angry, all the time, and what 
if, after everything that I’ve been through, something’s gone wrong inside me? What is I’m becoming bad?  
SIRIUS: I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry. You’re not a bad person. You’re a very good person who bad 
things have happened to. I understand. The- the world isn’t split into good people and Death Eaters. We’ve all got both 
light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That’s who we really are.  
HERMIONE: (knock, knock, knock) Harry, time to go. 
SIRIUS: When all of this is over, we’ll be a proper family. You’ll see.

CORNELIUS FUDGE: (from Daily Prophet) we have confirmed there’s been a high-security breakout in the early hours

that this breakout was engineered by a man with personal experience with escaping from Azkaban, notorious, massmurderer, Sirius Black,   a cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.

trying to say is that, I believe you.

HARRY: Neville…. 
NEVILLE: Fourteen years ago a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange used the Cruciatus Curse on my parents. She 
tortured them for information, but they never gave in. I’m quite proud to be their son, but I’m not sure I’m ready for 
everyone to know just yet. 
HARRY: We’re going to make them proud, Neville. That’s a promise.

from a variety of opponents….Fantastic! Remember, the Patronus will only be effective as long as you stay focused…

Proof of what I have been telling you right from the beginning! Oh, yes. All your mutterings about You-Know-Who coming 
back didn’t fool us for a minute. We saw your lies for what they were: a smoke screen for your bid to seize control of the 
Ministry. 
DUMBLEDORE: Naturally. 
HARRY: No, Professor! He had nothing to do with it. It was me. 
DUMBLEDORE: Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me. But as it has been pointed out, the parchment clearly says 
“Dumbledore’s Army,”    not “Potter’s”. I instructed Harry to form this organization, and I, and I alone, are responsible 
for it’s activities.  
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet. If we hurry we can still make the morning edition. Deloris, 
Shacklebolt, you will escort Dumbledore to Azkaban to await trial for conspiracy and sedition. 
DUMBLEDORE: Ahh…   I thought we might hit this little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I’m 
going to- what was the phrase? “Come quietly.” Well, I can tell you this, I have    no intention of going to Azkaban.

matter anymore, ‘cause I don’t want to play anymore, ‘cause all it does it make you want to care too much, and the more

their territory much more, and they’re going to have a full uprising on their hands.

Department of Mysteries.

Dumbledore’s hand finds his shoulder and Harry is moving,

… glass, a window, its surface prickling with another
kind of ambient light. We are looking INTO a conference
room where office workers sit around a table. But the

they are all rising, stepping to the window, mesmerized

3 EXT. DIAGON ALLEY – DAY 3

… Diagon Alley just as the front window of OLLIVANDER’S
WAND SHOP EXPLODES. Witches and wizards flee. In the
drifting smoke, DEATH EATERS appear, accompanied by a
tall, sinewy beast of a man, FENRIR GREYBACK. With a
casual sweep of his hand he sends a wizard flying and a
witch screams. In deep b.g., two Death Eaters abduct a
SHROUDED FIGURE (Ollivander). Greyback grins, then
APPARATES, along with the others…

… leaving Diagon Alley behind. The streets of London
appear below once more, and then the river. Black trails
– the Death Eaters — streak across the sky and then
turn TRANSLUCENT as they encircle the MILLENNIUM BRIDGE.
Pedestrians peer upward, bewildered, sensing a shift in
the atmosphere. And then…
The BRIDGE CRUMBLES into the THAMES, the image
horrifyingly beautiful, as is the SOUND of it, a ROAR, a
wail, the last cry of a lion. Then the image begins to
FADE and all goes slowly SILENT, until only a WHISTLING
WIND is heard and…

4 EXT. MILL TOWN – LATE AFTERNOON 4

… tall grasses toss dreamily in a SLANTING RAIN. An
OLD MILL lists like an ancient ruin against a charcoal
sky. A DARK FIGURE (NARCISSA MALFOY) MATERIALIZES. As
she turns for the town in the distance, another witch
materializes: BELLATRIX LESTRANGE.

Like a rat in a maze, Narcissa makes her way through a
labyrinth of dilapidated brick houses. Bellatrix trails.

BELLATRIX
Cissy! You mustn’t do this. He
can’t be trusted.
NARCISSA
The Dark Lord trusts him.

BELLATRIX
The Dark Lord is mistaken.

Narcissa turns, shocked. Bellatrix looks shocked
herself, rain running down her cheeks.
BELLATRIX
Or so I believe.

NARCISSA
Well, who can one trust these
days?

6 INT. MILL HOUSE – SAME TIME – LATE AFTERNOON 6

Grim and dark, lit by guttering candles. RAIN drums the
roof eerily. A KNOCKER CLANGS. A SQUAT MAN SHUFFLES
forth, something familiar in his gait.

7 EXT. HOUSE (SPINNER’S END) – SAME TIME – LATE AFTERNOON 7

The door cracks, spilling sallow light onto Narcissa and
Bellatrix. A face: WORMTAIL.

8 INT. HALLWAY – LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 8

The sisters follow Wormtail down a narrow hallway.

BELLATRIX
He lives in this Muggle dunghill?

Wormtail glowers over his shoulder at her. They pass
into…

9 INT. MILL HOUSE – SITTING ROOM – LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS 9
LATER)

… a room where a MAN sits by the window running with
RAIN, his face hidden by the Daily Prophet.

On the front page is a PHOTOGRAPH of the MILLENNIUM
BRIDGE CRASHING INTO THE THAMES. But even more prominent
is the SILHOUETTE of a YOUNG WIZARD and a HEADLINE:

HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?
Young Wizard Destined to Kill You-Know-Who?

The paper drops and SEVERUS SNAPE eyes the women
curiously.

SNAPE
Run along, Wormtail.

10 INT. MILL HOUSE – SITTING ROOM – LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS 10
LATER)
Snape fills the last of three goblets with wine.

NARCISSA
I’ve nowhere else to turn,
Severus.

Snape hands her a goblet, extends one to Bellatrix.

BELLATRIX
You must be joking.

Snape smiles faintly, brings the goblet to his own lips.

NARCISSA
I know I ought not to be here.
The Dark Lord himself has
forbidden me to speak of this –

SNAPE
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.
(eyes shifting)
Put it down, Bella. We mustn’t
touch what isn’t ours.

Bellatrix, DARK CURIO in hand, glowers, sets it back
down.

SNAPE
As it so happens I’m aware of your
situation, Narcissa.

BELLATRIX
The Dark Lord told you?
You?
SNAPE
Your sister doubts me, Narcissa.
Understandable.

SNAPE (CONT’D)
Over the years I have played my
part well. So well I’ve deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all
time.

Bellatrix makes a scathing sound. Snape turns, eyes
hard.

SNAPE
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.

NARCISSA
I… I don’t doubt you, Severus.

BELLATRIX
You should feel honored, Cissy.
As should Draco –

NARCISSA
He’s just a boy!

SNAPE
I can’t change the Dark Lord’s
mind. But it might be possible
for me to help Draco. To provide
some… protection.

Bellatrix eyes Snape keenly.

NARCISSA
Do you mean it, Severus?

SNAPE
I can try.
NARCISSA
Oh, Severus, please, if you

would… (I would be forever in

your debt.)
BELLATRIX
Swear to it.

Snape’s eyes shift, meet Bellatrix’s challenging gaze.

BELLATRIX
Make the Unbreakable Vow.
(as Snape looks away)
You see. It’s just empty words.
Oh he’ll try. He’ll give it his
best effort. But when it matters
most he’ll slither back into his
hole. Bloody coward…

(CONTINUED)

10 CONTINUED: (2) 10
Bellatrix goes on MUTTERING as she splashes some wine
into a goblet. Snape turns back, anger flashing in his
eyes.

SNAPE
Take out your wand.

Bellatrix freezes, goblet to her lips. As she lowers it,
a rivulet of red runs out of the corner of her mouth.

NEW ANGLE – MOMENTS LATER

Snape faces Narcissa. Bellatrix, hand faintly trembling,
places the tip of her wand over their LINKED hands.

BELLATRIX
Will you, Severus Snape, watch
over Draco Malfoy as he attempts
to fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes.

SNAPE
I will.

A SINGLE STRAND of LIQUID FIRE issues from Bellatrix’s
wand and wends its way around their hands.

BELLATRIX
And will you, to the best of your
ability, protect him from harm?

SNAPE
I will.

A SECOND STRAND of FIRE intertwines with the first.
BELLATRIX
And should it prove necessary, if
it seems Draco will fail… will
you yourself carry out the deed
that the Dark Lord has ordered
Draco to perform?

Snape’s hand TWITCHES within Narcissa’s. Bellatrix
waits.

SNAPE
I will.

11 EXT. LONDON UNDERGROUND – NIGHT 11

A TRAIN blasts through the station.

7.

12 EXT. “TREATS” FOOD STAND – SAME TIME – NIGHT 12

Late. Lonely men and women loiter on the platform. At a
food stand, patrons grimly read their TABLOID of choice.
CAMERA TRACKS PAST The Daily Mail, The Sun, The Mirror –
LANDS ON… the Daily Prophet. The SILHOUETTE. The
HEADLINE: “HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?”

But the (unseen) reader is fixated on a SMALLER ITEM,
tucked at the bottom corner of the back page: “Malfoy
Sentenced to Azkaban.” TWO PHOTOGRAPHS accompany the
piece, one of LUCIUS MALFOY, another of Narcissa and
DRACO MALFOY as they exit a courtroom. Draco’s eyes look
distant, haunted.

WAITRESS (O.S.)
Harry Potter. Who’s Harry Potter?
The paper drops, reveals… Harry. He glances up at the
YOUNG WAITRESS who stands over him. Pretty. Very
pretty.

HARRY
Oh. Um. No one. Bit of a
tosser.

As she leans over to clear his chips wrappings, Harry’s
gaze drifts over the smooth skin of her neck, the spray
of freckles across one cheek…

WAITRESS
Funny that paper of yours. Couple
nights ago, I could swear I saw
one of the pictures move.

HARRY
Really.

WAITRESS
Thought I’d gone round the twist.

She makes a face, smiles. A smile to die for. Starts to
go.

HARRY
Hey. I was wondering…

WAITRESS
Eleven. That’s when I get off.
(the smile)
You can tell me all about that
tosser Harry Potter.

Harry watches her go, then quickly reaches into his coat
and fumbles out a S’Mints container. Just then…
(CONTINUED)

8.
12 CONTINUED: 12
… a LIGHT on the opposite PLATFORM FLICKERS. Harry
looks. It FLICKERS again and this time a small cloud of
GLITTERING DUST dances over the opposite platform. As a
TRAIN ROARS past, Harry squints through the flickering
windows and watches the dust transform into… ALBUS
DUMBLEDORE. Leveling his glasses, he peers across the
platform, smiles and gives Harry a wave.

13 EXT. OPPOSITE PLATFORM – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 13

As Harry arrives, he finds Dumbledore studying a PERFUME
ADVERTISEMENT which shows a MODEL with a WAND in her
teeth: “Tonight Make a Little Magic With Your Man.”

DUMBLEDORE
I once knew a Muggle girl from
Liverpool with hair like spun
silk. No light could resist it…
(turning)
You’ve been reckless this summer,
Harry.

HARRY
I like riding round on the trains.
It takes my mind off… things.

Harry hesitates, notices Dumbledore’s hand is ASH BLACK.

DUMBLEDORE
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn’t
it? The tale is thrilling if I do
say so myself, but I’m afraid now
is not the time to tell it. Take
my arm.
(extending it)
Do as I say.

Harry glances across the platform, sees the freckled
Waitress appear, eye his empty table. Slowly, he reaches
out and — instantly — all goes BLACK in a RUSH of SOUND
and FURY, as if Harry had been pitched headlong into a
tornado. Seconds later…

14 EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 14

… he re-emerges into the world, reeling, eyes stinging
with tears. Slowly, his planet stops spinning.

HARRY
I just Apparated, didn’t I?

(CONTINUED)

14 CONTINUED: 14
DUMBLEDORE
Indeed. And quite successfully I
might add. Most people vomit
their first time.

HARRY
Can’t imagine why…

NEW ANGLE – MOMENTS LATER

Dumbledore leads Harry up a steep narrow street lined
with darkened houses.

DUMBLEDORE
Welcome to the charming village of
Budleigh Babberton, Harry. I
assume right about now you’re
wondering why I’ve brought you
here, am I right?

HARRY
(glancing about)
After all these years, I just sort
of roll with it, sir.

Dumbledore smiles mildly, then pauses, his face
darkening. Before them stands a SMALL STONE HOUSE. But
something is wrong about the place.

DUMBLEDORE
Wand out, Harry.

15 INT. SLUGHORN’S HOUSE – SAME TIME – NIGHT 15
THROUGH a crack in the front door: Dumbledore and Harry
move swiftly up the walk and enter.

DUMBLEDORE
Lumos…
The tip of Dumbledore’s WAND BLAZES. He sweeps the
shadows. CALLS OUT.

DUMBLEDORE
Horace!
Nothing. Dumbledore points his wand down a NARROW
HALLWAY. Motes of dust dance in the wandlight, but
nothing else. He starts down the hallway, toward the
OPEN DOORWAY at its end. Slowly, the room beyond comes
INTO VIEW:

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 10.

16 INT. SLUGHORN’S HOUSE – SITTING ROOM – NIGHT 16

Utter devastation. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK lays upon the
floor, its face cracked. A PIANO sags in the corner,
keys strewn like teeth upon the rug. A copy of the Daily
Prophet trembles in the breeze from a half-open window.
As Harry looks, a DROP of something WET strikes the word
“CHOSEN.” His gaze rises.

He GASPS. A substance DARK and GLUTINOUS is spattered
upon the ceiling. Dumbledore raises his wand. The
ceiling SCREAMS RED. Another drop falls and this one
strikes Harry’s SCAR. As Harry moves to wipe it away,
Dumbledore grabs his hand.

Training his light on Harry’s forehead, Dumbledore flicks
a blackened finger over the scar. Brings it to his
tongue. Reacts. Turning, his eyes narrow on an
OVERSTUFFED ARMCHAIR. Moving to it, he JABS his wand
into the plump seat cushion.

ARMCHAIR
Merlin’s Beard!
Instantly, the Armchair mutates into HUMAN FORM, though
briefly gets caught inbetween. After a bit of GRUMBLING,
SEAM-SPLITTING and the POPPING of a cushion button or
two, a FAT OLD MAN (HORACE SLUGHORN) in a pair of WELL-
WORN lilac pajamas appears.

SLUGHORN
(rubbing his rump)
There’s no need to disfigure me,
Albus!

DUMBLEDORE
I must say, you make a very
convincing armchair, Horace.

SLUGHORN
It’s all in the upholstery.
(patting his stomach)
I come by the stuffing naturally.
What gave me away?

DUMBLEDORE
(nodding to the
ceiling)
Dragon’s blood.

SLUGHORN
Yes, well, I couldn’t very well
use wizard’s blood, could I? Oho!

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 11.
16 CONTINUED: 16
Slughorn takes a step back, having spotted Harry. The
blood on Harry’s forehead only serves to highlight his
scar.

DUMBLEDORE
Ah yes. Introductions. Harry,
this is an old friend and
colleague of mine, Horace
Slughorn. Horace, this is, well,
you know who this is.
(a droll whisper)
Apparently there’s some thought he
may be the Chosen One.

Slughorn stares at Harry as if hypnotized.

DUMBLEDORE
So why all the theatrics, Horace?
You weren’t perhaps expecting
someone else, were you?

SLUGHORN
(blinking)
S-someone else? I’m sure I don’t
know what you mean.

Dumbledore raises an eyebrow. Slughorn caves.

SLUGHORN
Oh all right! The Death Eaters
have been trying to recruit me for
over a year. Do you know what
that’s like? One can only say no
to these people so many times
before they…
DUMBLEDORE
Take matters into their own hands?

Slughorn eyes Dumbledore miserably, gestures.

SLUGHORN
I never stay anywhere more than a
week. The Muggles who own this
place are in the Canary Islands.

DUMBLEDORE
Well, I think it should be put
back in order for them, don’t you?
Mind?

(CONTINUED)

12.
16 CONTINUED: (2) 16
Dumbledore raises his wand. Instantly, the grandfather
clock resumes its rightful place, shattered lanterns re-
ignite and the blood on the ceiling evaporates — just as
the piano keys tumble back into place with a pleasant
MUSICAL run.

DUMBLEDORE
That was fun. May I use the loo?

As Dumbledore heads down the hall, Slughorn calls after.

SLUGHORN
Don’t think I don’t know why
you’re here, Albus! The answer is
still no! Absolutely,
unequivocally no!
Dumbledore doesn’t respond. Slughorn glances at Harry.
The silence is palpable. Awkward. A beat. Then:

SLUGHORN
You look very like your father.
Except for your eyes. You’ve
got –

HARRY
My mother’s eyes, yeah.

SLUGHORN
(smiling softly)
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright — your mother.
Even more impressive when one
considers she was Muggle-born.

HARRY
One of my best friends is Muggle-
born. She’s the best in our year.

SLUGHORN
Oh, but you mustn’t think I’m
prejudiced! No, no, no! Your
mother was one of my absolute
favorites! Look, there she is.
Right up front.

Slughorn waves to a dresser crowded with PHOTOGRAPHS.

SLUGHORN
All mine, each and every one. Ex-
students, I mean. You recognize
Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor
of the Daily Prophet.

SLUGHORN (CONT’D)
Always takes my owl should I want
to register my opinion on the news
of the day. And there’s Ambrosius
Flume of Honeydukes. Sends a
hamper of chocolate to the house
each birthday. That is, when I
had a house. And Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies –
free tickets whenever I want them.
Of course, I haven’t been to a
match in some time…

Harry steps forward, takes a picture of one particular
BOY, a boy who resembles… Sirius. Seeing Harry thus
distracted, he studies him intently, like a rare object.

SLUGHORN
Ah yes. Regulus Black. You no
doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago. I
taught the whole Black family
except Sirius. Shame. Talented
boy. I got Regulus when he came
along, of course, but I’d have
liked the set.

DUMBLEDORE
Mind if I take this? I do love
knitting patterns.

Slughorn blinks, looks away from Harry and finds
Dumbledore standing there, clutching a MUGGLE MAGAZINE.

SLUGHORN
Of course. But you’re not
leaving?
DUMBLEDORE
I think I know a lost cause when I
see one. Regrettable. I would
have considered it a personal
triumph had you consented to
return to Hogwarts, Horace. You
are, like my friend Mr. Potter –
one of a kind.

17 EXT. SLUGHORN’S HOUSE – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 17

Dumbledore HUMS placidly as he and Harry make their way
down the walk. Seconds later, the front door swings
open.

SLUGHORN
All right! I’ll do it. But I’ll
be wanting Professor
Merrythought’s old office, not
that water closet I had formerly.
And I expect a raise! These are
mad times we live in! Mad!

DUMBLEDORE
Indeed they are.

18 EXT. STREET (BUDLEIGH BABBERTON) – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 18

Dumbledore leads Harry back toward the Village Square.

HARRY
Sir, exactly what was that all –

DUMBLEDORE
You are talented, famous and
powerful — everything Horace
values. Professor Slughorn is
going to try to collect you,
Harry. You would be his crowning
jewel. That is why he is
returning to Hogwarts. And it is
crucial he return…

Harry looks intrigued by this last statement, but before
he can pursue it, Dumbledore glances ruefully at the
moon.

DUMBLEDORE
I fear I may have stolen a
wondrous night from you, Harry.
She was, truthfully, very pretty.
The girl.

HARRY
It’s alright, sir. I’ll go back
tomorrow, make some excuse –

Harry stops. Dumbledore is shaking his head.

DUMBLEDORE
You’ll not be going back to Little
Whinging tonight, Harry.

HARRY
But, sir. What about Hedwig? And
there’s my trunk –

DUMBLEDORE
Both are waiting for you.

Dumbledore extends his arm. Mystified, Harry reaches
out. As his fingers touch the silk of Dumbledore’s
cloak, he…

19 EXT. THE BURROW – NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 19

… APPARATES INTO VIEW, stumbling to one knee and
wincing.

HARRY
Sir?

Dumbledore is gone. Harry rises, glances about. In the
distance a CROOKED HOUSE shimmers. A PRETTY GIRL with
RED HAIR flits briefly past an upstairs window. GINNY
WEASLEY.

20 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE – STAIRCASE – SAME TIME – NIGHT 20

Ginny DASHES down a vertiginous staircase, flies into the
kitchen and finds…

21 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE – KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS ACTION – NIGHT 21

… a LARGE TRUNK and an OWL CAGE. Curious, she cocks
her head to one side. The owl does the same in return.

GINNY
Hedwig…? Mum!

22 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE – DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY – SAME TIME – NIGHT 2

GINNY’S POV, looking up — a dizzying perspective of
twisting railings and crooked bedroom doors. A CLOCK
hangs IN VIEW, bearing NINE HANDS, each inscribed with a
Weasley name, each pointing to MORTAL PERIL. MRS.
WEASLEY appears, looks down.

MRS. WEASLEY
What is it, Ginny? Is it your
father? Has something happened at
the Ministry? Has he been
kidnapped? Is it the Death
Eaters?

GINNY
Exactly. How’d you guess?

Mrs. Weasley throws her hands up over her face.

GINNY
I’m joking, Mum.

MRS. WEASLEY
You’re worse than Fred and George.

GINNY
Now you’re joking. I was only
wondering when Harry got here.

MRS. WEASLEY
Harry who?

GINNY
Harry Dimpleton. Harry Potter, of
course.

MRS. WEASLEY
I think I’d know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn’t I?

GINNY
Well his trunk’s in the kitchen.
And his owl.

MRS. WEASLEY
I seriously doubt that.

Just then, HEDWIG SCREECHES O.S. Ginny gives her an I-
told-you-so when another door opens and RON WEASLEY looks
down.

RON
Harry? Did someone say Harry?
GINNY
Me, nosy. Is he up there with
you?

RON
`Course not. Think I’d know if my
best friend was in my room,
wouldn’t I?

Another door opens: HERMIONE, in a robe, TOOTHBRUSH in
hand.

HERMIONE
Was that an owl I heard?

GINNY
Harry’s. Haven’t seen him, have
you? Apparently, he’s wandering

HERMIONE
Really?

HARRY (O.S.)
Really.

Ginny spins. Harry. Standing in the doorway of the
kitchen.

RON/HERMIONE/MRS. WEASLEY
Harry!
As the others rocket downstairs, Ginny gives Harry a
great grinning hug. There is something oddly charged in
the moment, a surprise to both of them. The others
arrive. More hugs.

MRS. WEASLEY
But why didn’t you tell us you
were coming?

HARRY
Didn’t know.
(a shrug)
Dumbledore.

MRS. WEASLEY
That man. But then, what would we
do without him? Ron!

Ron is about to touch Hermione. She retracts her neck.
RON
You’ve a bit of…

He gestures to the stray lace of toothpaste on Hermione’s
chin. Quickly she wipes it off, gives him an odd look.

23 EXT. THE BURROW – ATTIC – NIGHT (LATER) 23

The Daily Prophet tumbles within a makeshift campfire of
BLUE FLAMES, but magically doesn’t disintegrate. Harry
teases the fire with the tip of his wand, where The
Chosen One? mingles with Draco’s haunted face in the
flames.

HARRY
When’d you get here?

HERMIONE
A few days ago. Though… for a
bit, I wasn’t sure I was coming.

Harry looks up, sees her glance at Ron.

RON
Mum sort of lost it last week.
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts. That it’s
too dangerous.

HARRY
Oh come on…

HERMIONE
She’s not alone. Even my parents
– and they’re Muggles — know
something bad is happening.

RON
Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her
she was being barmy. Took a day
or two, but she came round.

HARRY
But we’re talking about Hogwarts.
Dumbledore. What could be safer?
Hermione and Ron exchange another glance.

HERMIONE
There’s been a lot of chatter
lately. That he’s gotten… old.

HARRY
Rubbish. He’s only — what?

RON
A hundred and fifty. Give or take
a few years.

Silence. Nods. Then the three break out laughing. Grow
quiet again. Harry takes another poke at the Prophet.
Draco’s haunted face appears briefly, then is gone.

MAGENTA, stand upon a counter, selling to the masses:

FRED/GEORGE

FRED
Nosebleed Nougats…

GEORGE
And just in time for school…
FRED
Puking Pastilles!

A BOY stops chewing, turns PALE GREEN — literally.

FRED/GEORGE
Into the cauldron, handsome.

Together, with the tips of their toes, Fred and George
launch a SLOSHING CAULDRON down the counter, drop down on
either side of Harry, begin to steer him through the
store.

FRED
What’d you think, Harry?

HARRY
Amazing.
GEORGE
(to a browsing boy)
Pocket that and you’ll pay in more
than Galleons, my friend.

FRED/GEORGE
We’ve got eyes in the back of our
heads.

The boy, working a SCREAMING YO-YO, blanches as Fred and
George turn, reveal they do in fact have EYES IN THE BACK

GEORGE

Can’t breed them fast enough.

Just then a HUGE BOY (CORMAC McLAGGEN) passes behind
Hermione and, with his eyes, takes the full measure of

moves on.

How much for this?

A TINY WOODEN MAN ascends a TINY GALLOWS and… DROPS.
George rides a rolling ladder INTO FRAME, drops next to

25 EXT. DIAGON ALLEY – LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 25

The sun fades over an IRON ARCHWAY — Welcome to Diagon
Alley! — as Harry, Ron and Hermione pass beneath. All
around them, SHOPS sit silent, windows BOARDED-UP or
SHATTERED. People scurry by, avoiding the SCARY FACES of
the witches and wizards who peer out from the SECURITY
POSTERS plastered to every LAMP POST. Bellatrix is
there: “KNOWN DEATH EATER,” And Greyback: “WEREWOLF.”
And LUCIUS MALFOY: “CAUGHT.”

HERMIONE
How is it Fred and George are
doing it? Half the alley’s closed
down.

RON
Fred reckons people need a laugh
these days.

HARRY
Reckon he’s right…

Harry eyes the poster of Bellatrix, her mocking half-
smile.

HERMIONE
Oh no. Look.

Harry and Ron follow her gaze to the wreck that is
Ollivander’s Wand Shop.

HERMIONE
But everyone got their wands from
Ollivander. Young. Old…
HARRY
Good. Bad. Speaking of which…

Across the avenue, DRACO MALFOY and Narcissa pause,
glance around, then slip quickly down an alley.

RON
Is it just me? Or do Draco and
mummy look like two people who
don’t want to be followed?

26 EXT. VARIOUS STREETS – DIAGON ALLEY – LATE AFTERNOON 26

The trio trail Draco and Narcissa, who navigate these
dark streets with ease. Hermione, lagging a bit, glances

Harry and Ron duck inside a shop front. At the end of

Burkes. Narcissa and Draco enter, greet a STOOPED MAN
(BORGIN). He POINTS. Draco walks to a LACQUERED
CABINET, plays his fingers over its glassy surface.
Narcissa speaks and Draco turns, finds Borgin holding the
curtain to the back room aside. Draco hesitates, then
follows his mother through.

RON
What’re they playing at?

HARRY
Dunno. Let’s get closer.
RON

Hey. Where’s Hermione?

NEW ANGLE – ANOTHER ALLEY – DUSK

Hermione moves through the shadows, alone, peering down
side streets, each darker than the next, lost, but
holding it together, when… a SHADOW FLICKERS overhead.
She looks up, sees a FIGURE (Greyback) leap from one roof
to another. She stands perfectly still, then… hears
VOICES.

NEW ANGLE – OTHER ALLEYS – DUSK

Harry and Ron race down one passage then another. Stop.

I don’t know. I’m turned around.

NEW ANGLE – BORGIN & BURKES – BACK COURTYARD – DUSK

Hermione creeps to the end of a narrow passage, toward
the VOICES, and finds herself… behind Borgin & Burkes.
FIGURES encircle an old cauldron, among them Greyback,
Bellatrix, Narcissa, and in the very center… Draco.

Hermione squints against the brilliance of the FIRE, the
FIGURES twisting like Giacomettis. Draco extends his
left arm… when a SHADOW falls over Hermione, fingers
find her arm. She wheels, terrified.

Just then, the cauldron EXPLODES with light. Instantly,
the group, including Draco, disperses.

I don’t know.
Harry stares at the SMOKE drifting from the cauldron. A
SOUND RISES, growing more powerful and the ROAR of a…

LUNA LOVEGOOD moves down the aisle wearing a pair of RED
and BLUE CARDBOARD GLASSES (SPECTRESPECS) identical to
the ones modeled by a witch on the cover of the current
issue of The Quibbler, a stack of which Luna clutches to
her chest.

LUNA
There’s an article on Wrackspurts
this month. Quibbler…?

The loitering STUDENTS ignore her, including DEAN THOMAS,
currently WHISPERING to Ginny, who smiles mildly, more
interested in the PURPLE PYGMY PUFF perched on her
shoulder.

LUNA
He’s lovely. They’ve been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.

Harry, Ron and Hermione sit together. Hermione has a
book entitled Advance Rune Translation open on her lap,
while Ron lets Harry’s INVISIBILITY CLOAK play through
his fingers.

HARRY
Don’t you see, it was a ceremony.
An initiation.

HERMIONE
Stop, Harry, I know where you’re
going with this –

HARRY
It’s happened. He’s one of them.

RON
One of what?

HERMIONE
Harry is under the impression that
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

RON
You’re barking. What would You-
Know-Who want with a sod like
Malfoy?

HARRY
So what’s he doing in Borgin and
Burke’s? Browsing for furniture?

RON
It’s a creepy shop. He’s a creepy
bloke.

HARRY
Look. His father’s a Death Eater.
It only makes sense. Besides,
Hermione saw it. With her own
eyes.

HARRY

30 INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS – AISLE – DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 30

A blood-red sun shimmers through the windows, staining
the interior a deep scarlet. Students read, play cards.
In one compartment, CRABBE and GOYLE slumber sloppily.
As Harry enters, the ACCORDION doors to the NEXT CAR
SQUALL open and a PAIR of TWIN GIRLS emerge. He watches
them when a VOICE causes him to turn back. As the
accordion doors slowly close, he spies Malfoy sitting
with PANSY PARKINSON and a BOY with the cheekbones of a
sphinx (BLAISE ZABINI).
Harry studies Malfoy when a BOY pushes through the
accordion doors. As they begin to close, slowly, Harry
reaches into his pocket and removes the ORANGE AND BLACK
LUMP Fred gave him in Diagon Alley. He eyes Malfoy, eyes
the closing door and — impulsively — pitches the lump
into the air. It soars through the narrowing crease of
the doors and — just as Malfoy glances his way — just
as it reaches the apex of its flight — POOF! — explodes
softly, raining DARK POWDER.

CHAOS. PANICKED VOICES. Then, like a thinning mist, the
darkness eerily recedes, the red light of dusk returns
and Malfoy is revealed, standing in the DOORWAY of the
car. As he looks on warily, students return to their
seats. Across the way, Crabbe & Goyle continue to
slumber.

MALFOY
What just happened? Blaise?

BLAISE
(tense himself)
Don’t know.

Just then, a SMALL BAG TEETERS… then tumbles from a
luggage rack. Malfoy wheels, eyes the bag.

She pats the seat. Draco eyes the bag, slings it back
onto the luggage rack and plops down. Pansy strokes his
hair.

MALFOY
Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse
for a school. I think I’d pitch
myself off the Astronomy Tower if
I thought I had to continue on for
another two years.

Pansy, gently twisting one of Draco’s locks, stops.
PANSY
What’s that supposed to mean?

MALFOY
Let’s just say I don’t think
you’ll be seeing me wasting my
time in Charms Class next year.

Confused, Pansy glances at Blaise, who snorts derisively.

MALFOY
Amused, Blaise? We’ll see just
who’s laughing in the end.

Blaise shakes his head, smiling as he looks out the
window at the darkness. Just then the small bag in the
upper rack shifts. Malfoy’s eyes play over it.

The Hogwarts Express steams into the station.

As Blaise and Pansy make to exit, Malfoy takes down the
small bag, grips the handle thoughtfully.

MALFOY
You two go on. I want to check
something.

Malfoy slides shut the door. LETS THE BLINDS DOWN. A
beat.

MALFOY
Didn’t mummy ever tell you it’s
bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter?
Petrificus Totalus!
Malfoy wheels, points his wand at the luggage rack.
Something hits the floor with a THUMP. The Invisibility
Cloak slips away and reveals Harry, paralyzed on the
floor. Malfoy grins.

MALFOY
Oh, right, she was dead before you
could wipe the drool off your
chin.

Malfoy brings his boot down hard on Harry’s face. SNAP!
Blood squirts from Harry’s nose. Malfoy snatches up the
Invisibility Cloak, pitches it over Harry.

MALFOY
Enjoy the ride back to London.

36 EXT. STATION – EVENING (MOMENTS LATER) 36
Malfoy steps off, pulls his cloak tight and disappears
into the night. Softly, a SOUND rises, of a GIRL LIGHTLY

Luna Lovegood wanders down the aisle HUMMING, red and

ahead one compartment’s BLINDS are shut. Luna stops

The castle glitters. Harry, face blood-spattered, nose

HARRY
Sorry I made you miss the
carriages, Luna.

LUNA
It’s alright. I enjoyed our walk.
It was like being with a friend.

HARRY
I am your friend, Luna.

LUNA
That’s nice.

Just then PROFESSOR FLITWICK rushes forth clutching a
long roll of PARCHMENT bearing all students’ names.

FLITWICK
About time! I’ve been looking all
over for you two. Names.

HARRY
Professor Flitwick, you’ve known
me for five years.

FLITWICK

FLITWICK
Aurors. For security.

MALFOY (O.S.)
It’s a not a cane, you cretin.
It’s a walking stick.

Harry and Luna turn. Draco stands amidst a mountain of
TRUNKS and OWL CAGES, watching Filch pass a long SECURITY
DETECTOR over a WALKING STICK.
FILCH
And what exactly would you be
wanting with a walking stick?

SNAPE
It was his father’s.

Snape separates from the shadows. Draco eyes him warily,
then snatches the stick from Filch.

MALFOY
Is my father’s. He’s not dead.
Snape watches Malfoy carefully wrap the stick in felt,
lay it back inside his trunk.

SNAPE
It’s alright, Mr. Filch. I can
vouch for Mr. Malfoy.
Draco eyes Snape warily again, then begins to slouch off,
catches Harry looking.

MALFOY
Nice face, Potter.

Harry puts a hand to his nose, watches Malfoy disappear
into the darkness, trailed by Snape.

LUNA
Would you like me to fix it?
Personally I think you look a bit
more devil-may-care this way. But
it’s up to you.

HARRY
Brilliant.

40 INT. GREAT HALL – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 40
Hermione cranes her neck, looking for Harry, while Ron
stuffs his face with pudding, MUMBLING, MOUTH FULL:

RON
Don’ you worry. He’ll be `long
soon `nuff –

HERMIONE
(whacking him)
Will. You. Stop. Eating! Your
best friend is missing!
RON
Oi! Turn around, you lunatic.

Hermione spins, sees Harry and Luna approaching. In the
light of the hall, Harry’s blood-spattered face is quite
the sight.
GINNY
He’s covered in blood again. Why
is it he’s always covered in
blood?

RON
Looks like his own this time.

HERMIONE
(as he arrives)
Where’ve you been, Harry? And
what happened to your face?

HARRY
Later. What’ve I missed?

Sorting Hat urged us all to be

times — easy for it to say –
it’s a hat, isn’t it? First Years
seemed to enjoy it, though.
Wankers. Filch give you the wand
outside?

Harry nods. Ginny, damp napkin in hand, begins to dab
his face, then feels suddenly awkward. Harry takes it
from her.

HARRY
Thanks…
Just then, the light in the Hall begins to gently dim and
all eyes turn to Dumbledore, standing at the top of the
Hall, ashen hand raised to the enchanted ceiling, where
clouds respond to his gestures and shroud a gleaming full
moon.

HERMIONE
What’s happened to his hand?

DUMBLEDORE
The very best of evenings to you!
First off, please join me in
welcoming the newest member of our
staff, Horace Slughorn.

MILD APPLAUSE ensues. Harry claps perfunctorily, his
eyes drifting to the entrance of the Hall as a pair of
Aurors station themselves just outside.
DUMBLEDORE
Professor Slughorn, I’m happy to
say, has agreed to resume his old
post of Potions master. Meanwhile
the post of Defense Against the
Dark Arts will be assumed by
Professor Snape.

This is greeted by stunned silence. Dumbledore frowns,
then attempts to generate something by CLAPPING his hands
once. A few Slytherins join in and some dim-witted First
Years.

DUMBLEDORE
Now, as you know, each and every
one of you was searched upon your
arrival tonight. You have a right
to know why.

Once there was a young man who,
like you, sat in this very Hall.
Walked this castle’s corridors.
Slept beneath its roof. He
seemed, to all the world, a
student like any other. His name?
Tom Riddle.

The Hall goes utterly silent.

DUMBLEDORE
Today, of course, the world knows
him by another name. Which is
why, as I stand looking out upon
you all tonight, I am reminded of
a sobering fact. Each day, every
hour, this very minute perhaps,
dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle. But in the end,
their greatest weapon remains…
you.

Harry eyes Malfoy, slouched low, lazily levitating a fork
with his wand, as if Dumbledore were unworthy of
attention.

DUMBLEDORE
Just something to keep in mind.
Now, off to bed. Pip pip!

RON
(as they rise)
That was cheerful.

41 INT. CORRIDOR – MORNING 41

A TEEMING MASS of STUDENTS fight their way to class on
first day of term. Amidst it all, McGonagall stands tall
and stern. The twins pass by, bearing identical looks of
consternation.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
History of Magic is up, ladies,
not down. Mr. Davies — that’s
the girl’s toilet…

McGonagall’s eyes shift, find Harry and Ron sitting upon
a ledge, clearly deriving immense pleasure from the
chaos.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

Ron grins as Harry makes his way “upstream” to
McGonagall.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Enjoying ourself, are we?

HARRY
Well, you see, I’ve got an open
period this morning, Professor –

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
So I noticed. I would think you’d
want to fill it with Potions. Or
is it no longer your ambition to
become an Auror?

HARRY
It is. Or was. But I was told I
had to get an Outstanding in my
O.W.L. –

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
And so you did when Professor
Snape was teaching Potions.
However, Professor Slughorn is
perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T.
students with `Exceeds
Expectations.’

HARRY
Really? Well… brilliant. I’ll
head there straight away.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Good. And take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

42 INT. CORRIDOR/SLUGHORN’S CLASSROOM – MORNING (MOMENTS 42

Ron trails Harry toward an open door.

RON
But I don’t want to take Potions!

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 34.

43 INT. SLUGHORN’S CLASSROOM – CONTINUOUS ACTION – MORNING 43

As Harry drags Ron inside, the other students turn in
unison. Hermione frowns. Lavender, seeing Ron, beams.

SLUGHORN
Harry m’boy! I was beginning to
worry! And I see we’ve brought
someone with us…

RON
Ron Weasley, sir. But I’m dead
awful at Potions, a menace
actually, so I probably should
just be going –

SLUGHORN
Nonsense, we’ll sort you out. Any
friend of Harry’s is a friend of
mine. Right then, books out –

HARRY
Um, sorry, sir, but I haven’t got
my book yet — nor’s Ron. You
see — (until this morning…)

SLUGHORN
Not to worry. You can get what
you need from the cupboard.

As Harry and Ron step to the cupboard, Slughorn resumes,
gesturing to the cauldrons bubbling before him.

SLUGHORN
Now, as I was saying, I’ve
prepared a few concoctions this
morning. Any ideas what these
might be? Yes, Miss…?

HERMIONE
Granger, sir. That one there is
Veritaserum. And that would be
Polyjuice Potion. And that…

In the cupboard, Harry and Ron find two TEXTBOOKS — one
new, one shabby and soiled. Both snatch for the new when
a box — marked “BEZOARS” — tips. As Harry makes a grab
for it, Ron wrests free the new textbook and goes off
grinning.

HERMIONE
… is Amortentia! The most
powerful love potion in the world.

35.
43 CONTINUED: 43
HERMIONE (CONT’D)
It’s rumored to smell differently
to each person, according to what
attracts them. For example, I
smell freshly mown grass and
new parchment and spearmint
toothpaste –

Hermione blushes, stops herself. Slughorn regards her.

SLUGHORN
One of my best friends is Muggle-
born. She’s the best in our
year…
Harry, settling into his seat with the soiled textbook,
looks up just as Slughorn’s eyes shift to him for
confirmation. As Harry nods, Hermione glances curiously
at him.

SLUGHORN
Now Amortentia doesn’t create
actual love, of course. That’s
impossible. But it does cause a
powerful infatuation or obsession.
For that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this
room.

Slughorn turns, finds a sea of dreamy faces leaning into
the VAPORS. Instantly, he CLANGS a cover onto the
cauldron, bringing them round. As Ron blinks, he finds
Lavender still staring dreamily — at him. Noticing,
Hermione’s eyes narrow.

KATIE BELL
Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in
that one.

SLUGHORN
Ah yes…

Slughorn steps to a SMALL BLACK CAULDRON. Begins to
ladle a bit of GOLDEN LIQUID into a TINY VIAL.

SLUGHORN
What you see before you, ladies
and gentlemen, is a curious little
potion known as Felix Felicis.
But it is more commonly referred
to as –

HERMIONE
Liquid luck.

A buzz runs through the class. Even Malfoy perks up.
(CONTINUED)

36.
43 CONTINUED: (2) 43
SLUGHORN
Yes, Miss Granger. Desperately
tricky to make. Disastrous should
you get it wrong. But brewed
correctly, as this has been, it
has remarkable powers. One sip
and you will find that all your
endeavors succeed… at least
until the effects wear off.

KATIE BELL
But then why don’t people drink it
all the time?

SLUGHORN
Because taken in excess it causes
giddiness, recklessness and
dangerous overconfidence.

BLAISE
Have you ever taken it, sir?

SLUGHORN
Twice. Once when I was twenty-
four. Once when I was fifty-
seven. Two tablespoons taken at
breakfast. Two perfect days…

Slughorn eyes the vial dreamily, adrift. Finally he
blinks.

SLUGHORN
So. This is what I offer each of
you today. One tiny vial of
liquid luck… to the student who,
in the hour that remains, manages
to brew an acceptable Draught of
Living Death, the recipe for which
can be found on page ten of your
textbook.

Excitement seizes the class. Slughorn smiles knowingly.

SLUGHORN
You should know that in all the
years of my previous tenure at
Hogwarts, not once did a student
brew a potion of sufficient
quality to claim this prize. In
any event — good luck.

Slughorn sets the vial upon his desk, where it SHIMMERS
in a SHAFT of SUNLIGHT. Harry opens his book. Frowns.
The MARGINS of the page before him are black with the
tight SCRIBBLINGS of a previous owner.
(CONTINUED)

37.
43 CONTINUED: (3) 43
The same CREEPY GRAFFITI fills the next page as well, on
and on throughout the book. Shaking his head, Harry runs
his finger under the first PRINTED INSTRUCTION:

“Cut up one Sopophorous bean.”

Harry takes the SILVER DAGGER upon his desk, poises it
over the BEAN when… Ron’s bean shoots across the room
and bounces off Katie Bell’s head. Harry surveys the
rest of the room: everyone is struggling to cut the
resistant legume. He glances back to his book, considers
the instruction again.

As ARROW has been drawn from the word “Cut” to the
margin, where a modification has been written in the
tight scrawl:
“Crush with blade — releases juice better.”

Harry considers the dagger in his hand, then places the
flat of the blade against the bean and presses.
Instantly, the protective parchment covering the desk
runs RED with juice.

HERMIONE
How did you do that?

HARRY
Crush it. Don’t cut it.

HERMIONE
No. The instructions specifically
say to cut.

HARRY
No. Really –
HERMIONE
Sh!

Harry shrugs, lifts the parchment and tips the juice into
his cauldron. It HISSES, then turns LILAC. Harry grins.
CAMERA BEGINS SLOW DOLLY TOWARDS the vial of Felix
Felicis and…

MONTAGE BEGINS

Students struggle. A cauldron overflows. Lavender eyes
Ron.

CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD VIAL. THE SUNLIGHT SHIFTS.

Hermione grows more and more frustrated. Her hair grows
bushier in the steam rising from her cauldron…

Harry’s finger traces under the official instruction…
then drifts to the spidery scrawl in the margin…

Malfoy cuts himself, curses…

CAMERA CREEPS CLOSER TO VIAL. SUNLIGHT SHIFTS AGAIN.

Harry, cool as a cucumber, adds one last ingredient,
steps back, done…

Hermione, hair like Medea now, glowers at him…

THE LIGHT SHIFTS ONE LAST TIME. THE VIAL GLIMMERS LIKE
GOLD.

MONTAGE ENDS.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Slughorn wends his way amongst the cauldrons, nodding
with sympathy at the fiascos before him. Then… he
stops, staring in disbelief at the pearly sheen of one
bubbling potion.

SLUGHORN
Merlin’s Beard! But it’s perfect.
So perfect I daresay one sip would
kill us all! Your mother was a
dab hand at potions, but this…
My, my, what can’t you do, m’boy?
Perhaps you will save us all in
the end…

All eyes turn to Harry. His smile falters.
SLUGHORN
Here you are then, as promised.
One bottle of Felix Felicis. Use
it well.

Slowly, Harry reaches out… takes the glittering vial.

He briefly balances the ring upon the tip of an ashen

DUMBLEDORE
Good evening, Harry. You got my

Harry steps forward, eyes the Pensieve curiously. Sits.

Slughorn, for one, is most

Dumbledore smiles affectionately, nods.

DUMBLEDORE
And what of your activities

In any event, I’m sure you’re

Dumbledore swings open a cabinet where DOZENS upon DOZENS
of GLITTERING VIALS stand like tiny glimmering soldiers.

DUMBLEDORE
What you see before you are
memories. In this case pertaining
to one individual: Voldemort. Or
as he was known then… Tom
Riddle.

Dumbledore reaches down with his damaged hand and removes
a stoppered VIAL, dusty and veined with age.

DUMBLEDORE
This vial contains a most
particular memory — of the day I
first met him. I’d like you to
see it. If you would…

Dumbledore extends his ashen hand and Harry rises,
gingerly takes the vial and removes the cork. He tips
the contents into the Pensieve. Dumbledore nods and
Harry leans into the iridescent liquid, his face breaking
the surface…

A skinny, sharp-featured woman, MRS. COLE, leads
Dumbledore down a drab corridor. CHILDREN’S VOICES carry
from an unseen COURTYARD, splashing and shrieking, in the
midst of some game.

MRS. COLE
I must confess to a bit of
confusion upon receiving your
letter, Mr. Dumbledore. In all
the years Tom’s been here, he’s
never once had a family visitor.
Frankly, I was stunned to find
that someone knew of his
existence.
DUMBLEDORE
I am not family. But his name has
been known to me since birth.

MRS. COLE
I see…

But she doesn’t really. She stops, frowns.

MRS. COLE
I think I should tell you. He’s a
funny boy — Tom. Odd. There
have been incidents with the other
children. Nasty things.

DUMBLEDORE
Perhaps you could give me an
example.
Mrs. Cole starts to speak, then shakes her head, moves
off. As Dumbledore makes to follow, his eyes happen upon
a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall, old and yellowing,
depicting a SEASIDE SCENE of a SHARP ROCK OUTCROPPING and
a CAVE. As he exits, we HOLD ON it.

You’ve got a visitor, Tom.

48 CONTINUED: (2) 48
Dumbledore steps forward, extends his hand.

DUMBLEDORE
How do you do, Tom.

Riddle eyes Dumbledore briefly, looks away.

MRS. COLE
Well, I’ll leave you two to
yourselves.

Mrs. Cole exits, closing the door. Dumbledore studies
Riddle, then begins to tour the room. Carefully placed
upon a low shelf are some ODD SOUVENIRS. A grouping of
SEVEN STONES… A book containing SEVEN MATCHES. SEVEN
BRASS KEYS…
Moving on, Dumbledore passes a TALL CABINET, tracing his
FINGERS over its surface, as if the wood’s grain were
Braille, as if somehow “seeing” what lies within.

Then Dumbledore pauses. Strewn on a small table are a
grouping of SEVEN DARK DRAWINGS. A BOY and GIRL, their
faces anguished. A sea-swept CAVE. The same cave from
the photograph. Dumbledore begins to reach out…

TOM RIDDLE
Don’t.

Dumbledore stops, turns. Finds Riddle’s level gaze on
him.

DUMBLEDORE
As you wish.

Riddle looks away and Dumbledore, for the first time,
notices his hands. They are splayed, utterly still, and
INTERLACED with a SILKY WEB, where a SPIDER knits back
and forth.

TOM RIDDLE
You’re the doctor, aren’t you?

DUMBLEDORE
No. I am a Professor.

TOM RIDDLE
I don’t believe you. I hear Mrs.
Cole talking, her and the rest of
the staff. They want me looked
at. They think I’m different.

DUMBLEDORE
Perhaps they’re right.

(CONTINUED)

43.
48 CONTINUED: (3) 48
TOM RIDDLE
I’m not mad.

DUMBLEDORE
Hogwarts is not a place for mad
people.

Riddle looks up, cocks his head ever-so-slightly.

DUMBLEDORE
It’s a school. A school of…
magic.

Riddle stays looking, but says nothing.

DUMBLEDORE
You can do things, can’t you, Tom?
Things the other children can’t.

Riddle eyes Dumbledore intensely, unblinking.

TOM RIDDLE
Yes.

DUMBLEDORE
Tell me some of the things you can
do, Tom.

TOM RIDDLE
(watching the spider)
I can make things move — without
touching them. I can make animals
do what I want without training
them. I can make bad things
happen to people who are mean to
me. I can make them hurt… if I
want.

Dumbledore studies Riddle — then the boy looks up.

TOM RIDDLE
Who are you?

DUMBLEDORE
I’m like you, Tom. Different.

Riddle closes his hands and the web collapses.

TOM RIDDLE
Prove it.

It is not a request. Without breaking his gaze,
Dumbledore’s eyes narrow ever-so-slightly and… the
WARDROBE BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Riddle wheels.

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 43A.

Slowly smiles. Dumbledore studies him. Abruptly, the
wardrobe begins to SHAKE. Riddle’s smile fades.

(CONTINUED)

44.
48 CONTINUED: (5) 48
DUMBLEDORE
I think there is something trying
to get out of your wardrobe, Tom.
Open it. Open. It.

Terrified, Riddle steps to the burning wardrobe and
throws open the door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail
of threadbare clothes, a SMALL BOX SHAKES VIOLENTLY.

DUMBLEDORE
Take it out.

As Riddle’s fingers touch the box, the flames engulfing
the wardrobe vanish, but the box continues to SHAKE –
the only sound in the now-silent room.

DUMBLEDORE
Is there anything in that box you
ought not to have?

Riddle eyes Dumbledore, a trifle fearfully this time. He
spills the box onto the bed: a YO-YO, a silver THIMBLE,
and a tarnished MOUTH ORGAN.

DUMBLEDORE
Why did you want these things,
Tom?

TOM RIDDLE
(looking off)
I like having things that belonged
to other people. It makes me feel
… close to them.

Dumbledore studies Riddle’s profile, pondering this.
DUMBLEDORE
Thievery is not tolerated at
Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, you will
be taught not only how to use
magic, but to control it.
Understood?
(as Riddle nods)
I’ll be going now, Tom. Leave
your window open tonight. An owl
will bring you a message. Read it
carefully.

Dumbledore starts to exit, when:

TOM RIDDLE
I can speak to snakes too.

Dumbledore stops and we are ON his face, his back to
Riddle.

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 45.
48 CONTINUED: (6) 48
TOM RIDDLE
They find me. Whisper things. Is
that normal. For someone like me?

DUMBLEDORE
It is unusual. But not unheard
of.

Dumbledore exits then, without a backward glance, leaving
11-year-old Tom Riddle alone. The IMAGE SHUDDERS and…

49 INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE – NIGHT (PRESENT) 49

… Harry and Dumbledore reappear. The room has grown
DIM in their absence. Dumbledore gestures. LAMPS BLAZE
to LIFE.
HARRY
Did you know, sir? Then?

DUMBLEDORE
Did I know that I had just met the
most dangerous Dark Wizard of all
time? No. Had I…

Dumbledore falters, his expression troubled. Harry looks
up from the Pensieve, where young Tom Riddle’s fragmented
face floats on the surface, eyes Dumbledore.

DUMBLEDORE
Over time, while here at Hogwarts,
Tom Riddle grew close to one
particular teacher. Can you guess
which teacher that might be?
HARRY
You didn’t bring Professor
Slughorn back simply to teach
Potions, did you, sir?

DUMBLEDORE
No. I did not. You see,
Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.
And he will not part with it
easily…
(eyeing Harry
knowingly)
I’d rather not divulge any more
just yet, Harry. But I promise.
In time you will know everything.

(CONTINUED)

46.
49 CONTINUED: 49
HARRY
You said Professor Slughorn would
try to collect me.

DUMBLEDORE
I did.

HARRY
Do you want me to let him?

Dumbledore trails his ashen fingers in the surface of the
Pensieve, vanquishing young Tom Riddle’s face.

DUMBLEDORE
Yes.

50 EXT. QUIDDITCH PITCH – MORNING 50

Harry tries — with little success — to get the
attention of the throng of aspiring Quidditch players
assembled on the pitch.

HARRY
All right! Queue up! Excuse
me…

GINNY
SHUT IT!

Instant silence. Harry frowns, nods to Ginny
nevertheless.

HARRY
Thanks. All right. This morning
I’ll be putting you all through a
few drills to assess your
strengths. But know this: Just
because you made the team last
year does not guarantee you a spot
this year. Is that clear?

Ron looks unnerved at this, sweating so much he’s
attracted a PESKY FLY. CORMAC McLAGGEN, the huge boy
from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, sidles up.

CORMAC
No hard feelings, Weasley,
alright?

RON
Hard feelings?

(CONTINUED)

47.
50 CONTINUED: 50
CORMAC
I’ll be going out for Keeper as
well. Nothing personal.

RON
Really? Strapping guy like you,
you’ve got a Beater’s build, don’t
you think? Keeper needs to be
agile, quick –

Cormac nabs the FLY between two fingers, kills the BUZZ.

CORMAC
I like my chances. Say… think
you could introduce me to your
friend Granger? Wouldn’t mind
getting on a first name basis,
know what I mean?

Cormac gives a lewd wink, saunters off. Ron glances up
to the stands. Hermione smiles, waves.

BEGIN MONTAGE

Ginny flies swiftly, handling the Quaffle with ease.

TWO SECOND YEARS collide in mid-air.

Cormac makes a brilliant save.

Ron makes a shaky save.

Hermione looks on, nervous for him.

Katie Bell snatches a Quaffle with one hand, splits two
defenders beautifully and makes a slick blind pass to
Dean who jets high in the air, then lets the Quaffle roll
off his fingers… right into Ginny’s hands as she races
below.

Seamus sends a Bludger rocketing into the stands,
scatters a group of onlookers, leaving only Neville, who
sidles delicately to the right as the others leg it.

TWO THIRD YEARS collide in mid-air.

Cormac makes a brilliant save.

Ron turns the wrong way but makes the save anyway as the
Quaffle caroms off the tail of his broom.

Hermione looks on more nervously.

Beaters.

TWO FOURTH YEARS collide in mid-air.

Two aspiring Beaters “whiff” on a pair of Bludgers, whack
each other instead and plummet to the pitch as the
Bludgers ricochet off one another and go flying into the
stands, scattering onlookers yet again and leaving, as
before, only Neville. This time, he sidles delicately to
the left.

Cormac makes a brilliant save.

The Quaffle bounces off Ron’s head.

Hermione looks on extremely nervously.

TWO FIFTH YEARS collide in mid-air.
END MONTAGE.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The survivors press ICE PACKS to their heads, run TAPE
round twisted fingers. Only Ron, hovering at the west
goal, and Cormac, hovering at the east, remain on the
pitch. Luna, Spectrespecs in place, eyes Cormac — cool,
confident, clear. Then eyes Ron — sweaty, nervous,
SWARMING in WRACKSPURTS.

HARRY
All right. Cormac. Ron. It’s
down to you two for Keeper. We’ll
decide it with a shootout.
Demelza, you’ll bring the Quaffle
up against Cormac. Ginny, you’ll
take on Ron.
CORMAC
Hang on. She’s his sister. How
do I know she won’t toss him a
floater?

GINNY
Piss off, Cormac. How `bout I
toss you a floater?

HARRY
Quiet! I’m Captain. We do it my
way. Now line up. On three.
One. Two… Three!

Demelza and Ginny rocket forth. Ron weaves nervously
while Cormac hovers in place, a confident sneer on his
face.

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 49.
50 CONTINUED: (4) 50
HARRY
(under his breath)
C’mon, Ron…

Demelza hunkers over her broom once again, flying like an
arrow, then goes into a wide, sweeping slide. Ginny
blasts over the pitch, ginger hair streaming like flames,
then rolls recklessly to the side. As one, they both let
fly…

Hermione, face buried in her fingers, MUTTERS SOMETHING.

Cormac, at the last moment, inexplicably rolls his broom
to the right and the Quaffle sails over his shoulder.
Ron, zig-zagging crazily, nearly falls off, rights
himself in a panic, and deflects Ginny’s Quaffle… with
his forehead. As a few partisan CHEERS erupt from the
stands, Harry grins, then has to restrain himself.
Hermione opens her eyes slowly.

LAVENDER BROWN
Isn’t he brilliant?

Hermione stares balefully at Lavender, then notices
Cormac eyeing his broom incredulously. She gets up,
slips away.

51 INT. COMMON ROOM – NIGHT 51

Harry scans his Potions book. Hermione peruses the
Prophet. Ron cracks walnuts, pitching the pieces into
the fire.

RON
Have to admit, thought I was going
to miss that last one. Hope
Cormac’s not taking it too hard.

Behind her paper, Hermione rolls her eyes.

RON
Has a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.

HERMIONE
He’s vile.

Ron considers this, then glances across the room at
Lavender.

HARRY
Ever heard of this spell?

Harry points to a notation in the margin underlined three
times: “Sectumsempra. For Enemies.” Hermione frowns.

HERMIONE
No I have not. And if you had a
shred of self-respect you would
turn that book in.

RON
Not bloody likely. He’s top of
the class. Even better than you,
Hermione. Slughorn thinks he’s a
genius.

Hermione casts Ron a withering glance.

RON
What?

HERMIONE
I’d like to know just whose book
that was. Let’s take a look,
shall we?

HARRY
(holding it out of
reach)
No.

HERMIONE
(suspicious)
Why not?

HARRY
It’s… old. The binding is
fragile.
HERMIONE
The binding is fragile?
She makes another grab for it, but Harry holds it clear.
Then Ginny appears, plucks it out of his hand.

GINNY
Who’s the Half-Blood Prince?

HERMIONE/RON
The who?

GINNY
That’s what it says. Right here.
`This Book is the Property of the
Half-Blood Prince.’

52 EXT. MAIN STREET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) – DAY 52

Students lean into a bitter wind, trudging through deep
snow.

HERMIONE
For weeks you carry around this
book, practically sleep with it…
and you have no desire to find out
who The Half-Blood Prince is?

HARRY
I didn’t say I wasn’t curious.
And, by the way, I don’t sleep
with it.

RON
(a sarcastic chortle)
Yeah. Right.
(as Harry glares)
Well, it’s true. I like a nice
chat before I go to bed. Now
you’re always reading that bloody
book. It’s like being with
Hermione.

This time it’s Hermione’s turn to glare.

HERMIONE
Well, I was curious. So I went
to –
HARRY/RON
The library.

HARRY
And?

HERMIONE
And… nothing. There’s no
reference to the Half-Blood Prince
anywhere.

HARRY
Good. That settles it then.

Hermione starts to object, when:

HAGRID
Hey, you three!

(CONTINUED)

52.
52 CONTINUED: 52
HAGRID emerges out of the trees, beard crusted in white,
looking like a crazed Father Christmas. Behind him, deep
in the woods, DARK SILHOUETTES — AURORS — can be seen.
Hermione eyes them briefly, then nods to the PULSATING
BURLAP BAG Hagrid clutches in his fist.

HERMIONE
What’ve you got there, Hagrid?

Hagrid tips open the bag. The trio grimace. Hagrid
CHUCKLES.

HAGRID
Stinksap. Burn the whiskers right
off yer chin. Trees `ere are
drippin’ with it.
HERMIONE
Stinksap? You’re not sick, are
you?

HAGRID
It’s not fer me. It’s fer Aragog.
Yeh remember Aragog, don’ yeh?

RON
Spider? About six feet tall? Ten
feet wide?

HAGRID
Tha’s the one. He’s taken ill.
I’m hopin’ ter nurse `im back.
Keep yer fingers crossed.

Hagrid crosses his fingers. Ron forces a grin, does the
same, shakes his head as Hagrid disappears back into the
trees.

RON
Barking. Does he not remember
that raving arachnid tried to eat
us? What?

Ron sees Hermione staring at the Aurors again.

HERMIONE
The Aurors. I know they’re here
to protect us, but… somehow I
don’t feel any safer.

Just then Harry spies Slughorn, heading down towards the
Village, passing a weary Flitwick coming the other way.

HARRY
Who’s up for a Butterbeer?

53 INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS – DAY (LATER) 53

As the trio enter, Harry glances round, locates Slughorn
at the bar, planted plumply on a stool.

HARRY
No. Over here.

Hermione and Ron, in the midst of seating themselves at a
perfectly acceptable — and clean — table, see Harry
seat himself at one strewn with the detritus of a
previous customer — but which puts him in direct view of
Slughorn. They exchange a glance, shrug, join Harry.
Ron starts to take the chair directly opposite Harry –
blocking his view.

HARRY
No, no. Sit next to me.

Ron stops, exchanges another glance with Hermione.

RON
O-kay.

A SKINNY KID in an apron appears, tosses a FILTHY RAG
upon the table — which begins to wipe the surface on its
own. Harry cranes his neck around the kid to keep
Slughorn in view.

SKINNY KID
What’ll we have?
HERMIONE
Three Butterbeers. Splash of
ginger in mine, please.

The kid WHISTLES and the rag leaps back into his pocket.
Harry continues to eye Slughorn, when he sees Draco.
They lock eyes briefly, then Draco exits.

RON
Aw, bloody hell…

Harry turns, sees Ron glowering at Ginny, who sits in a
dark corner with Dean, their faces lit by a guttering
candle.

HERMIONE
Oh, honestly, Ronald. They’re
just holding hands…

And snogging.

RON
I’d like to leave.

HERMIONE
Leave? You can’t be serious.

RON
That happens to be my sister.

HERMIONE
So? What if she looked over here
and saw you snogging me? Would
you expect her to get up and
leave?
Ron blinks, utterly speechless. Then:

SLUGHORN
Harry, m’boy!
Slughorn’s voice BOOMS so loudly even Ginny jumps — and
catches Harry looking. As Slughorn waddles over,
SLOSHING mug in hand, Harry rises immediately — an
action so grossly out of character that Hermione regards
him with amused curiosity.

HARRY
Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

Hermione, brow wrinkling, turns to Ron, silently mouths:
wonderful to see you?
HARRY
So what brings you here, sir?

SLUGHORN
Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go
way back. Longer than I’d care to
admit. In fact, I remember when
it was simply One Broomstick!

As Slughorn GUFFAWS, Harry joins in, LAUGHING HEARTILY as
well. Slughorn’s belly trembles next to Hermione’s cheek
and his waving mug sloshes over, spattering the table.

SLUGHORN
Oops! All hands on deck, Granger!

Hermione smiles thinly, when a WHISTLE is heard and the
FILTHY RAG is back, whisking away Slughorn’s mess as the
SKINNY KID slides three foaming mugs onto the table.

53 CONTINUED: (2) 53
(In the b.g. Katie Bell emerges from the back, starts for
the exit. Her friend LEANNE follows her out.)

SLUGHORN
Listen, m’boy. In the old days, I
used to throw together the
occasional supper and invite a
select student or two. Would you
be game?

HARRY
I’d consider it an honor, sir.

SLUGHORN
You’d be welcome too, Granger.

Hermione, in the midst of emptying her Butterbeer in one
long draw, SLAMS down her mug — leaving behind a
“mustache.”

HERMIONE
Be delighted, sir.

SLUGHORN
Brilliant. Look for my owl.
(exiting, to Ron)
Good to see you, Wallenby.

Ron frowns as Slughorn waddles away, turns to Harry.

RON
What’re you playing at?

HARRY
Dumbledore asked me to… get to
know him.
RON
Get to know him?
HARRY
Dunno. But it must be important.
Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask.

Slam! Ron turns, sees that Hermione has emptied his mug
as well. Ron gestures to her upper lip.

RON
Um… You’ve got a little…

Without a thought, she flicks her tongue up, wipes it
clean.

56.

54 EXT. ROAD (OUTSIDE HOGSMEADE) – DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 54

The snow falls heavily now. Ron and Harry walk together,
while Hermione trails several yards behind, pirouetting
happily, letting snowflakes fall on her tongue.

RON
Bit worried about her. Did you
hear that rubbish she was talking
back in the pub? Her and me
snogging. Ha. As if…

LEANNE (O.S.)
Katie. You don’t know what it
could be!

Up ahead, Katie Bell and Leanne stand in the drifting
snow, ARGUING. Katie holds a SLENDER PACKAGE. Hermione
comes bumping up, drapes her arms over the boys.

HERMIONE
What’s up?

At that very instant, Katie Bell RISES SIX FEET INTO THE
AIR. Hair dancing violently in the wind, her face
remains eerily placid. Then she… SCREAMS. Harry and
Ron DASH FORWARD, seize her ankles. At their touch, she
FALLS to the snow, THRASHING and SHRIEKING, EYES ROLLED
UP in her skull.

LEANNE
I warned her! I warned her not to
touch it!

Hermione looks. Lying in the snow is the PACKAGE, TORN.
RON
Harry, she’s swallowing her
tongue –

HERMIONE
I’ll get someone –

HARRY
There’s no time!

Suddenly, a MASSIVE FIGURE LURCHES out of the WHITE:
Hagrid.

HAGRID
Get back! All o’ yeh!

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 57.

He says this so forcefully the others instantly obey.
Effortlessly, he scoops up Katie’s thrashing body and
then, as if calming a terrified animal, presses his face
close to hers and WHISPERS with great TENDERNESS:

HAGRID
Now, now. Now, now…

Over and over he repeats this, soothingly, the words like
a mantra, until Katie’s lids flutter and her body goes
limp.

HAGRID
Don’ go touchin’ tha’ but by the
wrappin’s. Unnerstan’?

Hagrid nods darkly to the package in the snow. Harry
kneels. Poking through the paper is an ORNATE OPAL
NECKLACE. Taking off his scarf he carefully enfolds
package and rises. Then, along with the others, he
watches Hagrid lumber off, Katie cradled in his arms. In
seconds they are swallowed by the snow. The only sound
is the ROAR of the WIND.

55 INT. McGONAGALL’S OFFICE – LATER (LATE AFTERNOON) 55

The necklace lies green and glittering upon McGonagall’s
desk.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
You’re sure Katie did not have
this in her possession when she
entered the Three Broomsticks,
Leanne?
LEANNE
It’s like I said. She went to the
loo and when she came back she had
the package. She said it was
important she deliver it.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Did she say to whom?

Leanne shakes her head.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
All right, Leanne. You may go.
(as Leanne exits)
Why is it always you three? Hm?
When something happens?

RON
Believe me, Professor, I’ve been
asking myself the same question
for six years.

Just then, Snape appears at the door, eyes the trio.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Severus.

SNAPE
Is this it?

McGonagall nods. Snape takes his wand, lifts the
necklace like a dead snake. Eyes it with fascination.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
What do you think?

SNAPE
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be
alive.

HARRY
She was cursed, wasn’t she? I
know Katie. Off the Quidditch
pitch she wouldn’t hurt a fly. If
she was bringing that to someone,
she wasn’t doing it knowingly.

Snape eyes Harry levelly.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Yes. She was cursed.

HARRY
It was Malfoy.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
That’s a very serious accusation,
Potter.

SNAPE
Indeed. Your evidence?

HARRY
I… just… know.

SNAPE
You… just… know. Once again
you astonish with your gifts,
Potter, gifts mere mortals could
only dream of possessing. How
grand it must be to be the Chosen
One.

56 INT. BOYS’ DORMITORY (GRYFFINDOR TOWER) – NIGHT 56

Harry and Ron lie awake in the darkened dormitory. Ron
stares at the ceiling. Harry eyes “Malfoy” on the
Marauder’s Map.

RON
What do you suppose Dean sees in
her? Ginny.
HARRY
What does she see in him?

RON
Dean? He’s brilliant.

HARRY
You called him a slick git not
five hours ago.

RON
Yeah, well, he was running his
hands all over my sister, wasn’t
he? Something snaps. You’ve got
to hate him. You know, on
principle.

HARRY
(troubled by this)
I suppose.

RON
So what is it? He sees in her?

HARRY
I don’t know. She’s smart.
Funny. Attractive…

RON
Attractive?

HARRY
You know. She’s… got nice skin.

RON
Skin? You’re saying Dean’s dating
my sister because of her skin?

Silence. Then:

RON
Hermione’s got nice skin.
Wouldn’t you say? As skin goes, I
mean.

HARRY
I’ve never really thought about
it. But I suppose, yeah. Very
nice.
Another silence. Suddenly it feels weird.

HARRY
I think I’ll be going to sleep
now.

RON
Right.

Harry sets the Map aside. We HOLD. Malfoy’s DOT moves
down the 7th Floor corridor… and disappears.

SLUGHORN (V.O.)
A toast!

57 INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE – NIGHT 57

Slughorn stands at the head of a table, goblet raised to
the students seated before him, which in addition to
Harry and Hermione include MARCUS BELBY, Blaise Zabini,
NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM and the TWINS. A distinctive CRYSTAL
HOURGLASS sits in the center of the table.

SLUGHORN
To Hogwarts’ best and brightest!

CORMAC
Here, here!

Hermione exchanges a wry glance with Harry, who notices
that ONE SETTING is EMPTY. The twins make — and drink –
their toast in perfect unison. Neville stares hopelessly
at the vast array of forks, knives and spoons placed
beside his plate.

NEVILLE
Which one do I use for the soup?

Hermione grins, looks up, and gets a WINK from Cormac.

CUT TO:

SAME SCENE – LATER

SLUGHORN
So tell me, Cormac. See much of
your Uncle Tiberius these days?

CORMAC
Yes, sir. In fact, I’m meant to
go hunting with him and the
Minister for Magic over holiday.

SLUGHORN
Well, be sure to give them both my
best. What about your uncle,
Belby? Working on anything new?
(to the others)
For those of you who don’t know,
Marcus’ uncle invented the
Wolfsbane Potion.

As he speaks, Belby never once looks up from his plate.

MARCUS BELBY
Dunno. He and me dad don’t get
on. Probably because Dad thinks
potions are rubbish. Says the
only potion worth having is a
stiff one at the end of the –
(day.)
SLUGHORN
And you, Miss Granger? What is it
your family does in the Muggle
world?

HERMIONE
My parents are dentists. They
tend to people’s teeth.

SLUGHORN
Fascinating. And is that
considered a dangerous profession?

HERMIONE
No. Though, a boy named Robbie
Fenwick did bite my father once.

As Slughorn nods, the door GROANS. Everyone turns.

SLUGHORN
Miss Weasley! Come in, come in.

GINNY
Sorry, I’m not ordinarily late –

She falters, eyes red, uncharacteristically flustered.

SLUGHORN
No matter. You’ll be just in time
for dessert. That is — if Belby
leaves you any.

As Ginny moves to her seat, Hermione WHISPERS to Harry.

HERMIONE
Look at her eyes. They’ve been
fighting again. Her and Dean.

Harry nods, then stands as Ginny reaches the table — the
only one. Hermione notices, eyes him with amusement as
he sits.

HARRY
What?
HERMIONE
Nothing.

As Hermione smiles, she lightly strokes the crystal
hourglass with a finger and we –

DISSOLVE TO:

58 INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE – NIGHT (LATER) 58

… LATER, the sand having run out with the evening.
Slughorn says his goodbyes.

SLUGHORN
Thank you, one and all, for a most
stimulating evening. We’ll have
to do it again.
Slughorn closes the door, turns, sends a FLOOR LAMP
WOBBLING and, catching it, finds Harry.

SLUGHORN
Oh. Potter.

HARRY
Sorry, sir, I was just admiring
your hourglass.

SLUGHORN
Ah, yes. A most intriguing
object. The sands run in
accordance to the quality of the
conversation. When it is
stimulating, the sands run slow.
When it is not…

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 63.
58 CONTINUED: 58
HARRY
I think I’ll be going.

SLUGHORN
Nonsense. You have nothing to
fear, m’boy. As for some of your
classmates, well, let’s just say,
they’re unlikely to make the
shelf.

Slughorn steps to a makeshift bar, begins to construct a
drink.

HARRY
The shelf, sir?

Slughorn gestures to the PHOTOGRAPHS seen earlier, now
ranged like a menagerie atop a low bookcase. Once again,
Lily Potter and Regulus Black up front.

SLUGHORN
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here. Then
again… you are already someone
aren’t you, Harry?

HARRY
I don’t really know how to answer
that, sir.

SLUGHORN
Your mother was modest too. Your
father not so much. As you can
see, he did not make the shelf.

Slughorn smiles genially, turns back to his drink, using
a pair of TONGS to drop ice into his glass.

HARRY
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf,
sir?

Slughorn stiffens, his back to Harry. His hand trembles
and the ice slips from the tongs. Harry notices.

HARRY
You knew him, didn’t you, sir?
Tom Riddle. You were his teacher.

SLUGHORN
Mr. Riddle had many teachers while
here at Hogwarts.

HARRY
What was he like?
(CONTINUED)

64.
58 CONTINUED: (2) 58
Harry can see the vein in Slughorn’s temple pulsating.
Fearing he may have overstepped…

HARRY
I’m sorry, sir. Forgive me. He
killed my parents, you see…

Harry stops, frowns. Slughorn turns, studies Harry.
Nods.

SLUGHORN
Of course. It’s only natural that
you should want to know more. I’m
afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry. When I first met young Mr.
Riddle, he was simply a quiet,
albeit brilliant, boy committed to
becoming a first-rate wizard. Not
unlike the others I’ve known. In
fact, not unlike… you. If the
monster existed, it was buried
deep within.

CLOSE ON THE HOURGLASS

Nary a grain trickles through.

59 INT. GREAT HALL – MORNING 59

Ron enters the Hall, eyes lowered, knuckles taped for
Quidditch, flexing his fingers anxiously as he makes for
the Gryffindor table. Neville passes going the other
way.
NEVILLE
Good luck, eh, Ron?

Ron nods shortly, then Seamus comes up on his side,
WHISPERS CONSPIRATORIALLY.

SEAMUS
Counting on you, Ron. I’ve two
Galleons on Gryffindor.

As Seamus peels off, Ron cuts his eyes toward the
Slytherin table, where the Quidditch team sits together.
One Slytherin juts his chin toward Ron, MUTTERS
something. A few turn, snigger. Ron averts his eyes
and… almost runs into Cormac, who eyes him with disdain
as he passes. Frowning, Ron drops down opposite Harry
and Hermione. Harry eyes him briefly, knowingly, pushes
a plate across. Ron takes a fork, pokes at it glumly.

RON
So. How was it?

Hermione continues to read the Prophet, unaware of Ron’s
mood.

HERMIONE
How was what?

RON
(with mock
refinement)
Your dinner party.

HERMIONE
Dead boring. Though I think Harry
enjoyed dessert.

(CONTINUED)

65.
59 CONTINUED: (2) 59
Harry’s eyes shift, find Hermione smiling faintly from
behind the Prophet.

HERMIONE
Ol’ Sluggy’s having a Christmas
do, you know. And we’re meant to
bring someone…

RON
I expect you’ll be going with
McLaggen. Isn’t he a member of
the Slug Club?

HERMIONE
Actually, I was going to ask you.

RON
Really?

HERMIONE
Really. But seeing as you have
such a distaste for the idea –

LAVENDER BROWN
(passing by)
Good luck today, Ron! I know
you’ll be brilliant!

Ron smiles feebly, looks back down at his plate.
Hermione stares daggers.

RON
I’m resigning. After today’s
match. McLaggen can have my spot.

Hearing this, Hermione turns back. Harry catches her
eye, extends a SHAKING HAND to indicate Ron’s mental
state.

HARRY
Have it your way. Juice?

Hermione blinks, surprised by Harry’s callousness. Ron
is surprised as well — and mildly put out.

RON
Sure…

As Harry pours, Luna arrives at the table wearing a HAT
that bears an uncanny resemblance to a real lion.

LUNA
Hello, everyone. You look
dreadful, Ron.

LUNA
Is that why you just put something
in his cup. Is it a tonic?

The tiny vial of Felix Felicis glints in Harry’s palm.

HERMIONE
Don’t drink that, Ron!

But Ron’s frozen in mid-sip, looking at Harry’s palm too.
Quickly, he gulps down the rest.

HERMIONE
You could be expelled for that.

HARRY
Dunno what you’re talking about.
Harry pockets the vial, winks at Luna. Ron rises.

RON
C’mon, Harry. We’ve got a game to
win.

CLOSEUP – QUAFFLE

As it ROCKETS into the AIR…

60 EXT. QUIDDITCH PITCH – DAY 60

Instantly, Slytherin snatches the Quaffle and rushes en
masse toward Gryffindor’s end, weaving and passing with
wicked skill, culminating in a vicious, slicing shot on
goal. Just when it appears it will clear the hoop, Ron
streaks out of nowhere and sends the Quaffle screaming in
the opposite direction. Ginny pauses on her broom,
stunned.

GINNY
What’s gotten into him?

She glances up at Harry, circling high above and he
grins. Just then, Dean streaks by:

DEAN
Ginny! Let’s go!

Instantly, she rolls backward, jets off and races down
her fellow Chasers. Flying in spread formation, Dean –
on the far wing — starts the Quaffle “up the line” until
it lands in Ginny’s hand.

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 67.
60 CONTINUED: 60
Pitching herself into a wide slide to avoid a PAIR of
WHISTLING BLUDGERS, she leans recklessly off her broom
and whips the Quaffle through the goal untouched.

As the CROWD SCREAMS, Harry eyes the Gryffindor section,
where Luna’s LION HAT ROARS, Lavender CLAPS for Ron and
Hermione sits with her arms crossed, a look of supreme
annoyance on her face. Harry grins, jets off.

61 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM – NIGHT 61

The room teems with students celebrating Gryffindor’s
victory. It feels like Mardi Gras. Or a mosh pit. Or a
riot. And Ron is right smack in the middle of it.

CROWD
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
Harry takes his backslaps on the periphery, smiling as he
sips a Butterbeer and enjoys Ron’s turn in the spotlight.

HERMIONE
Ron seems to be enjoying himself.

HARRY
Yep. Apparently it’s his lucky
day.

HERMIONE
You shouldn’t have done it, Harry.

HARRY
Yeah. I suppose I could’ve just
used, I dunno… a Confundus
charm?
HERMIONE
(caught)
That was different. It was
tryouts. This was an actual
match –

She stops. Harry dangles the vial. The SEALING WAX is
UNBROKEN, the bottle full.

HERMIONE
You didn’t put it in?
(as he shakes his
head)
Ron only thought you did?

He nods. She POPS him playfully on the arm when WHISTLES
and CATCALLS rise. They turn to see what the commotion
is about and find, smack dab in the center of the room…
(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 68.
61 CONTINUED: 61
Ron and Lavender. In a clinch. Kissing. Harry stares,
blinks, then turns back… to no one. His eyes shift,
track Hermione as she bumps through the crowd toward the
portrait hole.

62 EXT. CORRIDOR – NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 62

Harry leaves the ROAR of the party for the QUIET of the
corridor. Ahead, a door stands ajar. CHIRPING can be
heard.

63 INT. CHAMBER – SAME TIME – NIGHT 63

Hermione sits atop a desk, a small ring of TWITTERING
BIRDS circling her head. The birds change color as they
orbit, from sunny yellow to a dark, angry scarlet.

HERMIONE
Charms spell. Just practicing.

HARRY
Ah. Well… they’re really good.

HERMIONE
(studying her wand)
How does it feel, Harry? When you
see Dean with Ginny?
(off his look)
I know, Harry. You’re my best
friend. I see how you look at
her.

Just then the DOOR BURSTS WIDE and Ron rushes in, pulling
a GIGGLING Lavender by the hand. They stop. Take
inventory.

LAVENDER BROWN
Oops. I think this room’s taken.

As Lavender pulls Ron out, he cuts his VOICE LOW to
Harry.

RON
What’s with the birds?

Before Harry can reply, Hermione rises, points her wand.

HERMIONE
Oppugno!
Instantly the birds race like angry red bullets toward
Ron, who flees, SLAMMING SHUT the door.

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 69.
63 CONTINUED: 63
As the birds hit the door, they EXPLODE SOFTLY into small
FEATHER CLOUDS and Hermione covers her face and SOBS.
Harry goes to her, hesitates, then tentatively drapes his
arm over her. As she turns her face into his chest, he
pulls her closer, watching as, across the room, the last
scarlet feather drifts to the floor, joining the pool
already there.

HARRY
It feels like this.

64 EXT. CASTLE – WINDOW – SAME TIME – NIGHT 64

THROUGH the icy window, we see Harry cradling Hermione
within. As CAMERA DRIFTS AWAY, RISING THROUGH the
FALLING SNOW, the VIEW EXPANDS. In the Common Room, the
party rages on, while three windows down, Lavender pulls
Ron into a kiss. Figures pass by windows, including one
tall, pale boy standing at a WINDOW on the SEVENTH FLOOR:
Malfoy. As he turns away, the castle slides FROM VIEW
and the CAMERA TILTS UP TO the sky, drifting with snow.

65 INT. CORRIDOR – DAY 65

Tinsel decks the banisters and mistletoe droops from the
ceiling. As Ron and Harry make their way down the
crowded corridor, passing the BIRDCAGE, Ron walks with a
new air of confidence, not exactly strutting, but close.

RON
Look, I can’t help it if she’s got
her knickers in a twist. What Lav
and I have — well, let’s just say
there was no stopping it. It’s
chemical. Will it last? Who
knows? Point is, I’m a free
agent.

66 INT. LIBRARY – NIGHT 66

Harry trails Hermione through the stacks.

HERMIONE
He’s at perfect liberty to kiss
whomever he likes. I really
couldn’t care less. Was I under
the impression that he and I would
be attending Slughorn’s Christmas
party together? Yes. Of course,
now, given the circumstances, I’ve
had to make other arrangements.

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 70.
66 CONTINUED: 66
HARRY
Have you?

HERMIONE
Yes. Why?

HARRY
I just thought, you know, since
neither one of us can take who
we’d really like… maybe we’d go
together. As friends.

HERMIONE
(stopping)
Why didn’t I think of that?

HARRY
So who are you taking?

HERMIONE
(evasively)
Um… it’s a surprise. Besides,
it’s you we need to worry about.
And you can’t pick just anyone.
See that girl over there. That’s
Romilda Vane. Rumor has it she’s
trying to slip you a love potion.

HARRY
Really…?

Harry considers a fine-boned GIRL with RAVEN HAIR
(ROMILDA VANE). She is exquisite, an absolute work of…

HERMIONE
(snapping fingers)
Hey! She’s only interested in you
because she thinks you’re the
Chosen One. You know that, right?

HARRY
But I am the Chosen One.

Hermione cocks her head at him, exasperated.

HARRY
Okay. Kidding. I’ll just ask
someone I like. Someone cool.

71.

67 INT. STAIRCASE/CORRIDOR – NIGHT 67

Luna Lovegood, decked out in a set of SPANGLED SILVER
ROBES, and Harry, in basic black, make their way toward
the STRAINS of CHRISTMAS MUSIC, RED LANTERNS lighting
their way.

LUNA
I’ve never been to this part of
the castle. At least not while
awake. I sleepwalk, you see.
It’s why I wear shoes to bed.

As Harry and Luna pass out of sight, we PICK UP Malfoy,
standing in the shadows of an alcove. He watches them
go, then moves off.

68 INT. HOGWARTS CASTLE – ANOTHER CORRIDOR – SAME TIME – 68
NIGHT

In the f.g., the BIRDCAGE glimmers dully in the gray
moonlight streaming through a window. Within, the TWO
BIRDS huddle quietly. We RACK FOCUS and see, THROUGH the
grid of wire, a FIGURE APPROACHING.

Draco moves down the corridor, eyes fixed oddly ahead.
He looks pale in the moonlight. In his fist he grips an
APPLE. As he passes the cage, we HOLD ON the BIRDS.

69 INT. SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 69

Draco approaches. Stops. Turns to the wall. Closes his
eyes.

70 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT – NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 70

CAMERA GLIDES PAST dozens of TOWERING SHELVES, dust-
strewn and listing like dominoes, cluttered with all
matter of strange OBJECTS. Draco appears, his legs
pushing him on, wending his way through the narrow
passages.

NEW ANGLE – BEHIND LARGE RECTANGULAR MASS

We RISE ABOVE it, watch Draco walk directly TOWARD us and
stop. He stares at the solid mass before him. Reaches
out and takes the fringe of the tapestry covering it.
Tugs. The tapestry shivers like water to the floor,
revealing…

A CABINET, identical to the one in Borgin & Burkes.
(CONTINUED)

72.
70 CONTINUED: 70
Draco runs a hand over the glossy finish, comes away with
DUST upon his fingertips. Glancing around, he spies a
BUST of a WOMAN wearing a TIARA, removes the SILK SCARF
hanging from her porcelain neck and gently wipes the dust
away from the cabinet. Bringing the apple up, he opens
the cabinet and places it within. Shuts it. Closing his
eyes, he MUTTERS a LOW INCANTATION, barely discernible.

He reaches out. Opens it. The apple is gone. He closes
the cabinet again. Waits. Longer this time. Finally,
he opens it. Removes the apple. Rotates it.

Someone has taken a BITE out of it.

71 INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 71
FLASH! A CAMERA POPS, reveals Harry smiling with
Slughorn before a PHOTOGRAPHER (ADRIAN). The ceiling and
walls are draped with HANGINGS of emerald, crimson and
gold, so the room feels like a tent… or the inside of a
gift box. It is LOUD and packed with people.

SLUGHORN
Thank you, Adrian!
(quietly to Harry)
One of mine. Class of `78. I had
hoped for more out of him, but at
least the pictures are in focus.
(suddenly)
Oh my! Excuse me, Harry. I must
greet the new Minister of Magical
Transportation. Class of `67.
(as he goes)
Mingle, m’boy! Mingle! We’re all
friends here. And we run the
world.

Harry watches Slughorn make a beeline across the room,
along the way nodding to the twins, who have apparently
come with each other.

VOICE (O.S.)
Drink?

Harry turns, finds Neville standing with a tray.

HARRY
Neville…?

NEVILLE
I didn’t make the cut for the Slug
Club. It’s okay. He’s got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 73.
71 CONTINUED: 71
As Neville turns away, Harry notices a pair of GIRL’S
FEET protruding from beneath a CRIMSON HANGING. His gaze
rises, finds Hermione peeking out. As he moves off, we
see Luna talking to a small, stout bespectacled man
(ELDRED WORPLE).

ELDRED WORPLE
Lovegood, did you say? I once
encountered a seriously unbalanced
man by that name at a book
signing. Claimed to run a
magazine…

NEW ANGLE – HERMIONE – BEHIND THE HANGING – SECONDS LATER

HARRY (O.S.)
What’re you doing?

Hermione YELPS, turns, pulls Harry behind the hanging.
Her hair is slightly askew, her lipstick a bit blurry.

HARRY
And what’s happened to you?

HERMIONE
Hm? Oh, I’ve just escaped — I
mean, left Cormac. Under the
mistletoe.

HARRY
Cormac! That’s who you invited!
HERMIONE
I thought it would annoy Ron most.
But he’s a menace. He’s got more
tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.

WAITER (O.S.)
Dragon tartar?

They turn, find a WAITER peeking in, tray in hand.

HERMIONE
No thank you.

WAITER
Just as well. They give one
horribly bad breath.

HERMIONE
(grabbing the tray)
On second thought — maybe it’ll
keep Cormac at bay. Oh no, here
he comes!
(CONTINUED)

74.
71 CONTINUED: (2) 71
Hermione pops two of the Dragon blobs into her mouth,
shoves the tray in Harry’s hand and flits away.

NEW ANGLE – PARTY – SAME TIME

Snape, looking bored, stands on the periphery of a
conversation, when he sees Hermione exit one side of the
hanging and Cormac enter the other.

NEW ANGLE – BEHIND THE HANGING – SAME TIME

HARRY
I think she went to powder her
nose.
Harry looks past Cormac’s shoulder, out past the hanging
and sees Slughorn laughing with a guest. Cormac plucks a
dragon blob off the tray in Harry’s hand, pops it.

CORMAC
Slippery little minx, your friend.
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn’t she? Yak yak yak. What
is this I’m eating, by the way?

HARRY
Dragon balls.

As Cormac’s face freezes, Harry starts to head toward
Slughorn when the HANGING IS SWEAP ASIDE: Snape.

SNAPE
What’s going on back here?
Cormac SPEWS raw dragon all over Snape’s shoes. Snape
surveys the damage, then his eyes rise darkly.

SNAPE
You’ve just bought yourself a
month’s detention, McLaggen.

McLaggen dashes off. Harry makes to follow.

SNAPE
Not so quick, Potter.

HARRY
I think I should rejoin the party,
sir. My date…

SNAPE
… can surely survive your
absence for another minute or two.

(CONTINUED)

75.
71 CONTINUED: (3) 71
SNAPE (CONT’D)
Besides, I only wish to convey a
message.

HARRY
A message…?

SNAPE
From Professor Dumbledore. He
asked that I give you his best and
that he hopes you enjoy your
holiday. You see, he’s traveling
and won’t return until term
resumes.

HARRY
Traveling? Where?
Snape merely stares a Harry silently, briefly, then
exits, taking Harry’s gaze with him, to Slughorn once
again, wildly gesturing with a full glass of wine.

MALFOY (O.S.)
Take your hands off me, you
filthy squib!

A frown overtakes Slughorn’s face and he turns toward the
source of the commotion, exits Harry’s view. Harry
emerges from the hanging, finds Malfoy in Filch’s rough
grip.

FILCH
Professor Slughorn, sir! I’ve
just discovered this boy lurking
in an upstairs corridor. He
claims to have been invited to
your party.
MALFOY
Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing.
Happy?

SNAPE
I’ll escort him out.

Draco’s eyes shift, regard Snape. He shrugs free of
Filch.

MALFOY
Certainly… Professor.

72 EXT. DARK CORRIDOR – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 72

CAMERA GLIDES in the DARKNESS. VOICES are HEARD.

72 CONTINUED: 72
MALFOY (O.S.)
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn’t. What’s it to you?
Two SILHOUETTES come INTO VIEW — Malfoy, slumped against
the wall in lazy insolence, and Snape.

SNAPE
I swore to protect you. I made
the Unbreakable Vow –
MALFOY
I don’t need protection. I was
chosen for this! Out of all
others. Me! And I won’t fail
him.
SNAPE
You’re afraid, Draco. You attempt
to conceal it, but it’s obvious.
Let me assist you –
MALFOY
No! I was chosen. This is my
moment!
Malfoy exits. Then Snape.

WIDER ANGLE

Harry is revealed in an adjacent alcove. He’s heard all.
A TRAIN is HEARD…

73 EXT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS – MOVING – DAY 73
The Hogwarts Express CHUGS through a SNOWY COUNTRYSIDE.

74 INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS – MOVING – DAY 74

Ron lies on his back, while Harry sits opposite, leafing
through the Half-Blood Prince’s potions book.

RON
Unbreakable Vow. You’re sure
that’s what Snape said.

HARRY
Positive. Why?

RON
It’s just, well, you can’t break
an Unbreakable Vow.
(CONTINUED)

77.
74 CONTINUED: 74
HARRY
I’d worked that much out for
myself, funnily enough.

RON
No, you don’t understand — Oh,
bloody hell…

Lavender stands outside the compartment door. Fogging
the glass with her breath, she ETCHES “Ron + Lav,”
encircles it with a HEART, mimes “I miss you,” and exits
with a pout.

HARRY
Lovely.

RON
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped.
Look.

HARRY
I’ll take your word for it.

Just then, Hermione passes by, breaks stride as she spots
Lavender’s handiwork, then continues on. Ron shakes his
head.

HARRY
So what happens? If you break an
Unbreakable Vow?

Ron glowers, watching as Lavender’s heart slowly
VANISHES.

RON
You die.

75 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE – SAME TIME – NIGHT 75

The house glows with light and HOLIDAY MUSIC rings from
the WIRELESS. Fred and George fill cups with STEAMING
NOG and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny ferry plates of food.

MRS. WEASLEY
Eat up, eat up, everyone! There’s
more to come!

Harry sits in deep conversation with LUPIN, TONKS, and
MR. WEASLEY. Ron sits by silently. Lupin looks haggard.

HARRY
Draco’s plotting something, I know
it, something to do with
Voldemort. He’s been given a task
or a mission — and Snape was
offering to help.

LUPIN
Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy
for a mission?

HARRY
I know it sounds mad –

LUPIN
Has it occurred to you, Harry,
that Snape was simply pretending
to offer Draco help so that he
could find out what he’s up to?

HARRY
That’s not what it sounded like.

TONKS
Perhaps Harry’s right, Remus. To
make an Unbreakable Vow, after
all –

LUPIN
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore’s judgement.
He trusts Snape. Therefore, I do.

HARRY
But Dumbledore can make mistakes.
He’s said it himself –
LUPIN
You’re blinded by hatred.

HARRY
I’m not –

LUPIN
(sharply)
You are! People are disappearing,
Harry. Daily. We can only put
our trust in a handful of people.
If we start fighting amongst
ourselves, we’re doomed.

Tonks gives Harry a furtive glance, as if to say, “Leave
it.”

76 EXT. REEDS (SURROUNDING BURROW) – NIGHT (LATER) 76

Within the reeds. An eerie POV. TRACKING Harry and Mr.
Weasley as they walk from the house to the adjacent
WORKSHOP.

77 INT. MR. WEASLEY’S WORKSHOP – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 77

Harry trails Mr. Weasley through his cluttered workshop,
which is chock-a-block with MUGGLE OBJECTS: Steam irons.
Toasters. Clock radios. Plugs. Lots of plugs. The
PARTY can still be heard, drifting faintly from the main
house.

MR. WEASLEY
You’ll have to forgive Remus. It
takes its toll — his condition.

HARRY
(studying him)
Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?

Arthur tries a smile, but it fades. He frowns, pained.

MR. WEASLEY
We’re being followed, all of us.
Molly doesn’t leave the house most
days. It’s not been easy.
HARRY
(a nod, then)
Did you get my owl?

MR. WEASLEY
Yes, but I thought it best if I
replied in person. If
Dumbledore’s traveling, it’s news
to the Ministry. But perhaps
that’s the way Dumbledore wants
it. As for Draco Malfoy — I know
a bit more.

HARRY
Go on.

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 80.
77 CONTINUED: 77
MR. WEASLEY
I sent an agent to Borgin &
Burkes. From what you describe, I
think what you and Ron saw at the
end of the summer — the object
that Draco seemed so interested in
– was a Vanishing Cabinet.

HARRY
A Vanishing Cabinet?

MR. WEASLEY
They were all the rage when
Voldemort first rose to power.
You can imagine the appeal.
Should the Death Eaters come
calling, one needed only slip
inside and disappear for an hour
or two. But they’re tricky
contraptions. Require a
tremendous amount of looking
after. Eventually they fell out
of favor.

HARRY
What happened to it? The one at
Borgin & Burkes?

MR. WEASLEY
Nothing. It’s still there.

Harry nods, pondering this.

MR. WEASLEY
Harry. You know, I went through
all this before — the last time
around. Times like these — dark
times — do funny things to
people. It can bring them
together and it can tear them
apart. Things… speed up. It’s
what happens when you don’t know
if today will be your last.

78 EXT. REEDS (SURROUNDING BURROW) – NIGHT (LATER) 78

Similar eerie POV. On the porch, Molly and Arthur,
looking middle-aged and fragile, say goodbye to Lupin and
Tonks.

81.

79 EXT. PORCH – SAME TIME – NIGHT 79

While the others TALK, Lupin stands a bit off to the
side, staring into the reeds. His nostrils flair subtly.

TONKS
It was delicious, Molly. Really.

MRS. WEASLEY
You’re sure you won’t stay?

TONKS
No, we should go.
(under her breath)
The first night of the cycle is
always the worst –
Tonks gestures vaguely to the moon. Arthur glances at
Lupin.

ARTHUR’S POV – LUPIN’S HAND

… as the HAIRS on the knuckles RISE.

BACK TO SCENE

MRS. WEASLEY
Remus…?

80 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE – SECOND FLOOR – SAME TIME – NIGHT 80

Harry peers through the ripples of an imperfect
windowpane, studying the others below. A FLOORBOARD
CREAKS. He turns, watches Ginny emerge into the light,
in a robe, twisting her wet hair in a towel.

GINNY
Everyone gone to bed?

HARRY
Soon.

GINNY
I don’t sleep these days. So I
wash my hair. Silly, right?

Harry just stares at her, the air prickling with silence.
Ginny eyes him knowingly.

GINNY
Happy Christmas, Harry.

82.

81 EXT. PORCH – SAME TIME – NIGHT 81

Lupin continues to peer into the reeds. His PUPILS
CONTRACT.

TONKS
Sweetheart…

LUPIN
There’s someone out there. I can
smell him. There’s more than
one –

Suddenly — throughout the reeds — TORCHES BLAZE.

82 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE – SECOND FLOOR – SAME TIME – NIGHT 82
The rippled window behind Harry blushes with light.
Ginny’s eyes shift from Harry to the trees beyond.

GINNY
Oh my god…

Harry turns, his BREATH FOGGING the WINDOWPANE as, far
below, FLAMES SNAKE out of the reeds and SLITHER toward
the house. Bellatrix emerges, peering up through the
darkness toward Harry’s SILHOUETTE, a mad grin on her
face. As she SHRIEKS EERILY, his eyes flash with hatred.

83 EXT. WEASLEY HOUSE – PORCH – SAME TIME – NIGHT 83

Harry bursts through the front door, wand drawn, pelts
toward Bellatrix. She grins, turns, and vanishes into
the reeds.
MR. WEASLEY
Harry, no!

Flames race up the porch steps, climb the walls of the
house. Lupin draws his wand and races after Harry.

TONKS
Remus!

Ron, Fred and George appear, join Arthur as he dashes
toward the smoking marsh. Arthur glances back as Ginny
emerges.

MR. WEASLEY
Ginny, stay with your mother!

Without hesitation, she races for the reeds.

83.

84 EXT. REEDS (SURROUNDING BURROW) – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 84

Harry careens through the marsh, reeds flashing past,
then spies Bellatrix. She GRINS, looking like a crazed
wood nymph, then flits off, her LAUGHTER mocking him. As
he pursues, FIRE SNAKES through the reeds toward him.

NEW ANGLE

Fred, George, Ron and Arthur fan out, running full-out,
their feet kicking up SPARKS as SHADOWS splinter
throughout the reeds. It’s like chasing ghosts.

NEW ANGLES
Ginny, copper hair gleaming, races through the reeds.

Bellatrix leads Harry on, grinning madly.

Ginny comes dashing to a halt, chest heaving as she peers
into the smoking marsh. A HUGE FIGURE QUIVERS through a
veil of smoke. Ginny’s eyes SHIFT, see Bellatrix racing
forward through the reeds, then SHIFT back as the veil of
smoke evaporates, reveals… Greyback. Bellatrix makes
an ODD, CLICKING noise — like a signal — and Greyback
edges forward, sweeping away the reeds in front of him
and revealing…

… Harry as he pelts forward.

GINNY
No, Harry! It’s a trap!
Harry falters, looking toward Ginny’s voice and spies
Greyback. Bellatrix stops dead, wheels in her tracks
and, seeing Ginny, SHRIEKS with RAGE. Raising her wand,
she fires a BOLT of RED LIGHT which explodes in a SHOWER
of SPARKS around Ginny. Ginny fires back, then wheels
away, flashing through the reeds and coming face to face
with…

Greyback, sharp teeth glittering.

GREYBACK
Don’t you smell clean.

Just then, a BOLT OF BLUE bursts off Greyback’s back and
he turns, sees Harry standing several yards off. As
Greyback gives chase, Ginny pelts after and we CUT BACK
AND FORTH BETWEEN Harry, Ginny and the beast between
them, faster and faster, their BREATHS shortening
until…

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 84.
84 CONTINUED: 84
Greyback rushes into a clearing, panting, glancing about.

Just then, TWIN BOLTS of light blast from opposite sides
of the clearing and Greyback is lifted in the air,
slammed to the ground. As he regains his feet he looks
into the reeds and sees Harry and Ginny, wands poised.
He grins… when Bellatrix’s odd, CLICKING signal carries
through the night once again. Turning away, he exits.

Harry and Ginny slowly step out of the reeds, stare at
each other wordlessly. Then… Ron, Fred, George, Arthur
and Lupin come thrashing into the clearing, stop. All
around them, the reeds SMOKE, the flames dying. Across
the marsh, Bellatrix’s cackle rises briefly on the air –
then all is quiet.

HERMIONE (V.O.)
You’re lucky you weren’t killed.

85 INT. HOGWARTS CASTLE – CORRIDOR – SAME TIME – DAY 85

Hermione reads the Daily Prophet as she walks alongside
Harry. The HEADLINE is GLOOMY: “MORE DISAPPEARANCES.”

HERMIONE
You have to realize who you are,
Harry.

HARRY
(sharply)
I know who I am, Hermione,
alright?
(frowning)
Sorry.
HERMIONE
So tell me what Arthur said.

HARRY
If Dumbledore’s traveling places,
it’s news to the Ministry. But
get this: that night at Borgin &
Burkes? It seems Draco was
looking at a Vanishing Cabinet.

HERMIONE
What would Draco want with a
Vanishing Cabinet?

HARRY
You tell me.

Hermione frowns, pondering this. Then:

RON (O.S.)
Lav, c’mon. Of course I’ll wear

They glance ahead, see Ron and a pouting Lavender. Ron
holds a GOLD CHAIN which spells out “My Sweetheart.”

LAVENDER BROWN
That’s my Won-Won.

HERMIONE
Excuse me, I have to go vomit.

As Hermione exits, Harry spies Ginny, in an alcove,
sitting by as Dean laughs with SEAMUS. Looking up, she
sees Harry, gives a feeble wave. He waves back and we –
CUT TO:

86 INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE – NIGHT 86

HARRY’S FACE PLUNGING INTO WATER, BREAKING THE SURFACE…

87 FLASHBACK – INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE – NIGHT (YEARS PAST) 87

We emerge from the CRACKLING EMBERS of a FIREPLACE. A
much younger — and more smartly dressed Slughorn probes
a dish of CRYSTALLIZED PINEAPPLE as he holds court before
16-YEAR-OLD TOM RIDDLE and five other BOYS. The CRYSTAL
HOURGLASS sits on a side table.

TOM RIDDLE
Sir, is it true that Professor
Merrythought is retiring?
Slughorn chuckles, wags a sugar-encrusted finger at
Riddle.

SLUGHORN
Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I
knew, could I? I must say, m’boy,
I’d like to know where you get
your information. More
knowledgeable than half the staff,
you are.
(as the other boys
laugh)
By the way, thank you for the
pineapple — you’re quite right,
it is my favorite — how is it you
knew?

(CONTINUED)

86.
87 CONTINUED: 87
TOM RIDDLE
Intuition.

Riddle smiles but his expression suggests intuition had
nothing to do with it. Slughorn chuckles uneasily.

SLUGHORN
Good gracious, look at the time.
Off you go, boys, or Professor
Dippett will have us all in
detention. Lestrange, Avery,
don’t forget your essays…

As the others file out, Slughorn busies himself with some
papers when — Ping! — he turns, finds Riddle still
there, standing by the crystal hourglass.
SLUGHORN
Look sharp, Tom. You don’t want
to be caught out of bed after
hours…

TOM RIDDLE
I know a secret shortcut or two.

SLUGHORN
Yes, I imagine you do. Something
on your mind, Tom?

TOM RIDDLE
Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of
anyone else to go to. The other
professors, well, they’re not like
you. They might… misunderstand.

SLUGHORN
Go on.

Riddle slips off the RING on his left hand, begins to
roll it between his fingers. It is set with a BLACK
STONE.

TOM RIDDLE
I was in the library the other
night, in the Restricted section,
and I read something rather odd,
about a bit of rare magic, and I
thought perhaps you could
illuminate me…

Suddenly, a DENSE FOG engulfs the room and SLUGHORN’S
VOICE twists into an ANGRY SHRIEK:

(CONTINUED)

87.
87 CONTINUED: (2) 87
SLUGHORN
I don’t know anything about such
things and I wouldn’t tell you if
I did! Now get out of here at
once and don’t ever let me catch
you mentioning it again!
The FOG grows thicker and…

88 INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE – NIGHT (PRESENT) 88

… CAMERA EMERGES FROM the swirling Pensieve. Harry
blinks, finds Dumbledore studying him from across the
room.

DUMBLEDORE
Confused? I would be surprised if
you weren’t.

HARRY
I don’t understand — what
happened?

DUMBLEDORE
This is perhaps the most important
memory I’ve collected. It’s also
a lie.
(off Harry’s look)
This memory has been tampered
with. In this case by the person
whose memory it is, our friend
Professor Slughorn.

HARRY
But why would he tamper with his
own memory?

DUMBLEDORE
I suspect he is ashamed of it.

HARRY
Why?

DUMBLEDORE
Why indeed.

Dumbledore trails his withered fingers in the Pensieve.

DUMBLEDORE
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn and you’ve done
so.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

88.
88 CONTINUED: 88
DUMBLEDORE (CONT’D)
Now I want you to persuade him to
divulge his true memory. Any way
you can.

HARRY
I don’t know him that well, sir –

DUMBLEDORE
You’re the Chosen One, Harry. And
Horace is, at heart, a decent man.
Provide the proper circumstances
and he will confess his sins.

Dumbledore lifts his fingers from the Pensieve, studies
them. They are, in this moment, iridescent, whole.

DUMBLEDORE
This memory is everything, Harry.
Without it, we are blind. Without
it, we leave the fate of our world
to chance. You have no choice.
You must not fail.

As Harry watches, the damp sheen enveloping Dumbledore’s
hand evaporates and once again his fingers decay.

89 INT./EXT. SLUGHORN’S CLASSROOM – DAY 89

As the CLASS BELL RINGS, a group of FIRST YEARS rise.

SLUGHORN
Now don’t forget to look over the
chapter on antidotes. I’ll be
poisoning one of you next time we
meet. I’m joking! Off you go!
Don’t forget your rattails, Miss
Alys.

As the tiny ones scurry out, Harry is revealed, waiting
just outside the door. He enters. For a moment,
Slughorn merely HUMS over his briefcase, unaware.
Then…

SLUGHORN
Ah! If it isn’t the Prince of
Potions himself! To what do I owe
the pleasure?

HARRY
Well, sir, I wondered if I might
ask you something.

SLUGHORN
Ask away, my dear boy, ask away!
(CONTINUED)

89.
89 CONTINUED: 89
HARRY
Well, you see, the other day I was
in the Restricted Section — in
the library — and I stumbled upon
something rather odd while
reading. Something about a bit of
rare magic…

SLUGHORN
Yes? And exactly what was this
rare magic.

HARRY
I’m not sure… That is, I don’t
recall the name… exactly. But
it got me wondering… Are there
some kinds of magic you’re not
allowed to teach?

Slughorn looks up, eyes Harry carefully.

SLUGHORN
I’m a Potions Professor, Harry.
Perhaps your question would best
be posed to Professor Snape.

HARRY
Yes, well, we don’t exactly see
eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to
say is, he’s not like you. He
might… misunderstand.

Recognition flickers in Slughorn’s eyes. A glint of
fear.

SLUGHORN
There can be no light without the
dark. And so it is with magic.
Myself, I have always strived to
live within the light. I suggest
you do the same.

Slughorn gathers his briefcase, starts to exit.

HARRY
Did you say the same to Tom
Riddle, sir? When he came asking
questions.

Slughorn freezes in the doorway, then slowly turns.

SLUGHORN
Dumbledore put you up to this.
Didn’t he? Didn’t he!

(CONTINUED)

90.
89 CONTINUED: (2) 89
HARRY
Sir –

Slughorn silences him with an upraised hand. Then,
without another word, he is gone.

90 INT. CORRIDOR – DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 90

Lightning flashes. Thunder rumbles. Rain lashes the
windows. Through the birdcage’s grid of wires someone
approaches. We RACK FOCUS… FIND Harry. As he passes,
we HOLD ON the cage. One bird is missing. Only the
BLACK one remains. As thunder BOOMS, the bird RUFFLES
its feathers.

Harry glances down the corridor adjacent, sees a FIGURE
start up the far stairwell. As the SHADOW ASCENDS, Harry
follows.

91 INT. CORRIDOR – SAME TIME – DAY 91

The FIGURE continues on, passes OUT OF VIEW. Harry
follows.

92 INT. CORRIDOR – SAME TIME – DAY 92

Harry, still trailing. The FIGURE turns a corner…

93 INT. SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR 93

… comes INTO VIEW. It’s Draco. He stops halfway down,
looks back the way he came. HARRY’S SHADOW scales the
wall as he approaches. Draco watches calmly, then turns,
CLOSES HIS EYES. And simply… DISAPPEARS.

Harry turns the corner. Stops. No one.

94 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT – DAY (SECONDS LATER) 94

Draco wends his way through the towering shelves, removes
the tapestry and faces the gleaming cabinet. He reaches
into his coat and carefully removes the WHITE BIRD.
Holding it in one hand, he studies it, gently stroking
its feathers with the other. For a moment, he seems lost
in the activity, lost in the bird’s coal black eyes, its
bobbing head. Then, gently, he places it in the cabinet
and closes the door. Waits.

When he opens the cabinet, the bird is gone. He closes
the cabinet once more.
(CONTINUED)

91.
94 CONTINUED: 94
A feather, white and gleaming, clings to the cuff of his
jacket. He takes it, turns it in the light. It is
fragile, translucent. He looks briefly lost again, then
blinks, turns back to the cabinet, slowly reaches out and
opens it. The bird is there.

Dead.

95 INT. COMMON ROOM – NIGHT 95

Hermione does her homework while Harry peers at the
Marauder’s Map. They are the only ones present.

HERMIONE
Did you actually expect you could
just walk up to Ol’ Sluggy and ask
him to reveal his deepest, darkest
secret? Honestly, Harry,
sometimes I think the Daily
Prophet should call you the Dim
One.

HARRY
Nice.

HERMIONE
(rising to go)
You’re going to have to persuade
him somehow. And now, I’m afraid,
you’ve made it a lot harder.

HARRY
Hermione. I think Malfoy’s
leaving the castle.
Hermione stops dead, looks back at Harry. He nods.

HARRY
I’ve seen it. Sometimes…
sometimes he just disappears off
the Map.

HERMIONE
That’s… not possible. No one
can leave the castle these days.
The Map is wrong.

HARRY
The Map is never wrong.

Hermione frowns, thinking, then shakes her head, turns
away.

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 92.

96 INT. BOYS’ DORMITORY (GRYFFINDOR TOWER) – NIGHT (LATER) 96

Harry slumps into the darkened dormitory. Stops. On the
floor, glittering in the moonlight, is a trail of CANDY
FOILS. A bit further along, Ron sits in his PJ’s upon
the window sill, a HEART-SHAPED BOX by his side.

RON
It’s beautiful, isn’t it? The
moon.

HARRY
Divine. Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?

RON
It was on your bed. The box.
Thought I’d try one…

HARRY
Or twenty.

RON
I can’t stop thinking about her,
Harry.

HARRY
Really? Honestly, I reckoned she
was starting to annoy you.

RON
She could never annoy me. I
think… I think I love her.

HARRY
Excuse me?
Ron nods. Harry looks bewildered.

HARRY
Well… Brilliant.

RON
Do you think she knows I exist?

HARRY
Bloody well hope so. She’s been
snogging you for three months.

RON
Snogging? Who’re you talking
about?

HARRY
Who’re you talking about?
(CONTINUED)

93.
96 CONTINUED: 96
RON
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

Harry stares at Ron… then grins.

HARRY
Okay. Very funny.

He turns to his bed, throws back the covers when… the
heart-shaped box caroms off his head.

HARRY
What the hell was that for?
RON
It’s no joke! I’m in love with
her!
HARRY
Okay! Fine! You’re in love with
her! Have you ever actually met
her!

RON
No. Can you introduce me?

Harry stops rubbing his head, eyes Ron oddly, then
glances at the candy box at his feet. There is an
envelope. Taking it, he slides out a card: “Dear Harry.
Thinking sweet thoughts of you. Happy Valentine’s Day.
Romilda.” He suppresses a smile.

HARRY
Ron, these chocolates, they’re –
C’mon. I’m going to introduce you
to Romilda Vane.

97 INT. CORRIDOR – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 97

Harry leads Ron, still in his PJs, toward a door.

RON
How do I look?

HARRY
Devastatingly handsome.

Harry RAPS on the door. FOOTSTEPS — followed by a LOUD
CRASH.

SLUGHORN (O.S.)
Damn it all!

(CONTINUED)

94.
97 CONTINUED: 97
The door OPENS. Slughorn stands in a GREEN VELVET
DRESSING GOWN and matching NIGHTCAP, looking bleary-eyed
and annoyed. Something SMOKES on the floor behind him –
the FLOOR LAMP he’d sent wobbling the night of the dinner
party.

SLUGHORN
Yes???!!!!
(warily)
Oh. Potter. It’s you. I’m
afraid I’m busy at the moment –

He starts to close the door. Harry sticks his foot in.

HARRY
Sir. I’m sorry. I wouldn’t
bother you if it weren’t
absolutely –

RON
Where’s Romilda?

Slughorn squints over Harry’s shoulder at Ron who is
doing precisely the same from the other side.

SLUGHORN
What’s the matter with Wenby?

Harry leans forward, WHISPERS into Slughorn’s ear. He
frowns.

SLUGHORN
Ah. Very well. Bring him in.

98 INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 98
Slughorn, with practiced ease, mixes a concoction of
powders and potions into a goblet while Ron peers into a
mirror. As he paces, Harry passes “the shelf” and finds,
front and center, a PHOTOGRAPH of himself and Slughorn –
the one taken at the Christmas party. In deep b.g. is
photograph of Snape, as a young student, clutching his
POTIONS TEXTBOOK.

SLUGHORN
I’d have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time,
Harry — an expert potioneer like
you.

HARRY
I figured this called for a more
practiced hand, sir.

(CONTINUED)

95.
98 CONTINUED: 98
RON
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

Slughorn and Harry turn, watch Ron WINK into the mirror.

SLUGHORN
Hm. Perhaps you’re right.

As Slughorn goes back to mixing, Harry eyes him
furtively.

HARRY
I’m sorry, sir. About the other
day. Our… misunderstanding.

Slughorn eyes Harry briefly, looks away.
SLUGHORN
Yes, well, water under the bridge
as they say, correct?

HARRY
I mean, I’m sure you’re tired of
it, after all these years. The
questions. About… Voldemort.

Slughorn’s mixing hand falters instantly.

SLUGHORN
I’ll ask you not to use that name.

Slughorn’s stare is fierce. Finally, he turns, goblet in
hand, and puts a smile on his face, his voice cheery.

HARRY
Yes, sir. It’s just, well,
Dumbledore once said that fear of
a name only increases fear of the
thing itself. It seemed sensible.

SLUGHORN
With all due respect, Dumbledore
sometimes forgets that most of us
do not possess powers so great
that we can risk offending the
most dangerous Dark Lord who ever
lived.

Slughorn’s stare is fierce, as fierce as the one
Dumbledore fixed Harry with. Finally, he turns away.

SLUGHORN
Alright, m’boy! Bottoms up!

SLUGHORN
A tonic for the nerves.

Ron drinks. Beams briefly. Then his grin sags.

RON
What happened to me?

HARRY
Love potion.

SLUGHORN
And a bloody strong one at that.

RON
I feel really… bad.
SLUGHORN
Pick-me-up’s what you need, m’boy.
(eying Harry again)
Do us all good, I think. I’ve got
butterbeer, wine — ah — and a
dazzling oak-matured mead. I had
other intentions for this but
given the circumstances…

Slughorn takes a STOUT BOTTLE and fills a glass for Ron.
As Ron SIPS, Slughorn fills a pair for he and Harry.

SLUGHORN
There we are, Potter. To life!

CRASH! — Ron’s glass hits the floor and he crumples to
his knees, then tumbles full out on the rug, SPASMING
horribly, FOAM oozing over his lips. Harry rushes to
him.
HARRY
Ron! Professor, help him!
Ron!!!
SLUGHORN
I d-don’t understand –

HARRY
Professor! Do something!!

Slughorn shuffles haplessly through his bag, MUMBLING, at
a loss. Harry turns back to Ron — his skin is turning
BLUE.

HARRY
He’s choking!!

(CONTINUED)

97.
98 CONTINUED: (4) 98
Harry glances about, then leaps up, and frantically
begins to strip the walls of its potion stores, looking
for something, anything. A box tumbles, something
spills: a scattering of stones, no bigger than a robin’s
egg, shriveled and dry. Snatching one, he wrenches open
Ron’s jaw and THRUSTS it deep into his THROAT. Instantly
Ron stops moving, paralyzed. The room is suddenly
silent. He’s not breathing. Harry places both hands
behind Ron’s head and gives it a SHAKE. Another.

HARRY
Breathe! C’mon, Ron, don’t be a
prat. Breathe! BREATHE!

Harry shakes him again and again… then stops. Ron’s
head rolls limply from his fingers. Slughorn looks on,
mouth agape. Useless. Then… A COUGH, a great
hiccupping COUGH — like a swimmer almost drowned — and
Ron is back. Breathing.

RON
These girls are gonna kill me,
Harry.

Harry grins. Then Ron’s eyes flutter. Out. But
breathing.

99 INT. HOSPITAL WING – EARLY MORNING (LATER) 99

Harry, Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Ginny and a very
somber Hermione circle Ron’s bed as MADAM POMFREY
ministers to him. Slughorn sits off to the side, in a
chair, looking stunned.

DUMBLEDORE
Quick thinking on your part,
Harry. Using a Bezoar. You must
be very proud of your student, eh,
Horace?

SLUGHORN
Hm? Oh. Yes… very proud.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
I think we all agree that Mr.
Potter’s actions were heroic. The
question is: Why were they
necessary.

DUMBLEDORE
Why indeed.

Dumbledore takes the half-empty bottle of mead, still
bearing a bit of GIFTWRAP.
(CONTINUED)

98.
99 CONTINUED: 99
DUMBLEDORE
This appears to be a gift, Horace.
You don’t by chance remember who
gave you this bottle, do you –
which by the way possesses
remarkably subtle hints of
licorice and cherry when not
polluted with poison.

SLUGHORN
Actually I had intended to give it
as a gift myself.

DUMBLEDORE
To whom might I ask?

SLUGHORN
You, Headmaster.

Just then — the DOOR BURSTS OPEN: Lavender Brown.

LAVENDER BROWN
Where is he? Where’s my Won-Won!
Has he been asking for me?
(stopping; glaring
daggers)
What’s she doing here?

HERMIONE
I might ask you the same.

LAVENDER BROWN
I happen to be his girlfriend.

HERMIONE
I happen to be his… friend.
LAVENDER BROWN
Don’t make me laugh. You haven’t
spoken in weeks. I suppose you
want to make up with him now that
he’s suddenly all interesting.

HERMIONE
He’s been poisoned, you daft
dimbo! And for the record, I’ve
always found him interesting.
Hermione frowns, a bit embarrassed. Ron SNORTS,
stirring.

LAVENDER BROWN
Ha! See? He senses my presence.
I’m here, Won-Won. I’m here –

Ron, in a haze, reaches out blindly. Blushing, Hermione
takes his hand. Instantly, he falls unconscious again.
Lavender, vibrating with rage, stalks out. Dumbledore
beams.

DUMBLEDORE
Ah, to be young and feel love’s
keen sting. Come, everyone, I
think Mr. Weasley is well tended.

As Dumbledore leads the others past Harry, Harry studies
him. Ginny passes, face very close, WHISPERING as she
indicates Ron and Hermione.
GINNY
`Bout time, don’t you think?

Harry watches her go, hopelessly smitten, sees that
Slughorn has paused in the doorway.

SLUGHORN
I’ve always cherished my students.
They’re my life…

Then he is gone too. Harry turns back, studies Hermione,
hand enfolded over Ron’s. She looks up, sees his faint
smile.

HERMIONE
Oh shut up.

100 INT. GREAT HALL – DAY 100
Harry spoons soup into his mouth while perusing the Half-
Blood Prince’s Potion book, his eyes lingering, as
before, over the SECTUMSEMPRA SPELL: “For Enemies.” Ron
absently twirls his wand as he covertly eyes Lavender.
Hermione frowns over the Prophet when… a snowflake
falls upon her nose.

HERMIONE
Ron. Stop. You’re making it
snow.

RON
Huh?

Ron looks up, sees that it is SNOWING exclusively over
the trio. Hermione places her hand atop his wand and he
blinks, as if the gesture kindles some sense-memory.

RON
Tell me again how I broke up with
Lavender?

Harry pauses on his soup, exchanges a glance with
Hermione, who carefully withdraws her hand from Ron’s.

HERMIONE
Um, well, she came to visit you in
the hospital, you see, and you
talked — I don’t believe it was a
long conversation –

RON
Don’t get me wrong. I’m bloody
thrilled to be shot of her. It’s
just she seems… a bit put out.
As one, the three glance over at Lavender and are
rewarded with a lethal squint.

HERMIONE
Does, doesn’t she? And you say
you don’t remember a thing from
that night? Not one thing?

RON
Well… there is… something.
(as Hermione hangs)
But no. It can’t be. Besides, I
was completely boggled, wasn’t I?

HERMIONE
Right. Boggled…

Hermione slumps back, frowning. Harry smiles with
amusement. Just then, a MILD COMMOTION draws his
attention. At the back of the Hall, a group of girls
surrounds a new arrival.

HERMIONE
That’s Katie. That’s Katie Bell.

Katie Bell, pale but smiling, greets the other girls.
After a moment, she looks up. Finds Harry standing
before her.

HARRY
How are you, Katie?

KATIE BELL
Give me a moment, girls.

The girls drift off. Harry watches them go, curious,
then:
(CONTINUED)

101.
100 CONTINUED: (2) 100
KATIE BELL
I know you’re going to ask, Harry.
But I don’t know who cursed me.
I’ve tried to remember. Honestly.
But I just… can’t…

Katie’s eyes shift. She goes ashen. Harry turns,
follows her gaze and finds… Malfoy, staring at her.
Katie backs away, retreating to the other girls. Harry
watches her go, then looks back. Catches Malfoy fleeing
the Hall.

101 INT. CORRIDOR – DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 101

Malfoy hurtles past, forehead gleaming with sweat, passes
OUT OF FRAME. Seconds later, Harry appears, follows. As
he passes the birdcage… we HOLD. It’s now EMPTY.

102 OMITTED 102

103 INT. BATHROOM – SAME TIME – DAY 103

Malfoy lurches to the mirror, steadies himself against
the sink. Then, with a great, heaving shudder begins
to… CRY.

In the MIRROR, we see the bathroom DOOR ease open:
Harry. He stops, stunned. Malfoy’s eyes shift.
Horrified to be exposed. He wheels, points his wand.
WHOOSH! The LAMP next to Harry’s head SHATTERS. FLAMES
spider up the ceiling.

Harry draws his own wand, fires back. The CISTERN behind
Malfoy EXPLODES and WATER sweeps the ceiling, rains down.
Malfoy HOWLS with RAGE. Harry readies himself.

MALFOY
Cruci–
HARRY
SECTUMSEMPRA!
BLOOD SPURTS from Malfoy’s face and SCARLET SLASHES OOZE
through the white of his shirt. He staggers, HOWLS again
and COLLAPSES. Harry glares at his wand in horror, then
slushes across the floor, the water running red with
Malfoy’s blood.

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 102.
103 CONTINUED: 103
MALFOY
Don’t touch me! Don’t you dare
touch me!
Harry stops dead… transfixed by a FLASH of SOMETHING
DARK pushing through the wet fabric of Malfoy’s
shirtsleeve. Just then… Snape BURSTS THROUGH THE DOOR.
Seeing Malfoy — and the nature of his injuries — he
eyes Harry with keen curiosity. Kneeling, he traces the
TIP of his WAND over Malfoy’s wounds, MURMURING an EERIE
INCANTATION. Instantly, the skin begins to knit itself
together. Harry backs away, Snape’s ancient CHANT
ringing in his ears, blood floating like crimson flowers
on the floor, backing away until he reaches the door…

104 INT. COMMON ROOM – DAY 104
Harry sits numbly, the Potions textbook lying limp in his
hand. Hermione, Ron and Ginny sit together, a bit apart,
keeping a kind of vigil. Finally, Ginny rises, steps to
him.

GINNY
You have to get rid of it. Today.

105 INT. SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR – DAY (LATER) 105

Harry, Potions book in hand, follows Ginny past the empty
birdcage and down the corridor when she pauses, turns to
the wall and shuts her eyes.

GINNY
Take my hand.

106 INT. ROOM 0F REQUIREMENT – DAY (SECONDS LATER) 106

Ginny and Harry materialize.

HARRY
The Room of Requirement…

Ginny nods, turns away. Harry follows.

NEW ANGLE – SECONDS LATER

Harry eyes the shelves that tower above him and the odd
things they hold: a SMALL CAGE bearing the SKELETON of
some long-dead creature. A JAR of QUIVERING EYEBALLS
which track him as he passes.

(CONTINUED)

103.
106 CONTINUED: 106
GINNY
Over the years, if someone had a
secret, if they wanted to conceal
something, this is where they
came. Some of these things are
almost as old as the castle
itself.

HARRY
Who showed you this? First.

GINNY
Fred and George. First year. I
hid Tom Riddle’s diary here for a
time. Wish I’d left it…

As Ginny drifts in the memory, Harry studies her, then a
SCUFFLING SOUND is heard nearby. They turn, look off.

GINNY/HARRY
(at the same time)
What was that?

They turn back, look at each other. Ginny smiles. Then:

NEW ANGLE – BEHIND VANISHING CABINET

Harry and Ginny approach. The SCUFFLING GROWS LOUDER.
Harry reaches out, pulls aside the tapestry. Reacts.
The cabinet door VIBRATES. Slowly, he opens it and…

… the BLACK BIRD flies free in a rush of FLAPPING
wings.

GINNY
See, you never know what you’ll
find up here.

Harry nods, looks back to the cabinet, mystified.

GINNY
All right. Close your eyes. That
way you can’t be tempted.

Ginny slips the book from his fingers and starts to back
away. She mouths: Close… your… eyes. As she leaves
FRAME, CAMERA PUSHES EVER-SO-SLOWLY IN ON Harry. Still.
Waiting. For a long moment, there is only silence. Then
a shadow gently eclipses Harry’s face.

GINNY
There’s something else. Another
secret of sorts. One of mine…

(CONTINUED)

104.
106 CONTINUED: (2) 106
Ginny leans in then and places her mouth on Harry’s.

GINNY
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.

Harry opens his eyes, watches Ginny back away, then
disappear around the corner. He stares at the empty air,
blinking, then watches the black bird flutter overhead.

107 INT. CORRIDOR – LATE AFTERNOON (LATER) 107

Harry, looking a tad dazed, walks aimlessly.

RON (O.S.)
So. Did you and Ginny do it?
Harry jumps, watches Ron appear.

HARRY
What?

RON
You know. Hide the book.

HARRY
Oh. Yeah.

Just then, Slughorn rounds the far end of the corridor
and — spying Harry — does a little Oliver Hardy “Oops”
and retreats.

RON
Still no luck with Slughorn, I
take it?
Harry shakes his head — then stops cold, stares at the
empty space where Slughorn stood moments before.

HARRY
Say that again.

108 INT. COMMON ROOM – DUSK 108

The tiny VIAL of FELIX FELICIS glimmers in Harry’s palm
as he and Ron and Hermione huddle in the empty dormitory.
They exchange glances, then Harry brings the vial to his
lips.

HERMIONE
Well? How do you feel?

(CONTINUED)

105.
108 CONTINUED: 108
HARRY
Excellent. Really excellent.

HERMIONE
Now remember. Slughorn usually
eats early, takes a short walk and
then returns to his office.

HARRY
Right. I’m going down to
Hagrid’s.

HERMIONE
What? No, Harry — you’ve got to
go see Slughorn. We have a plan –

HARRY
No. I’ve got a good feeling about
going to Hagrid’s. I feel like
it’s the place to be tonight, know
what I mean?

HERMIONE/RON
No.

HARRY
Trust me. I know what I’m doing.
Or at least Felix does.

109 INT. CORRIDOR – DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 109

A BOY with a PREFECT’S BADGE patrols the corridor.
Bored, he ponders the progress of his FAINT MUSTACHE in a
mirror. Harry walks by, unseen.

110 INT. ENTRANCE HALL – DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 110

Filch paces, standing guard while Mrs. Norris sits calmly
by. A MOUSE appears in the OPEN helmet of a SUIT OF
ARMOR, washes its face with its tiny paws, then spies
Mrs. Norris — who HISSES. The mouse makes a quick
retreat and the FACE PLATE comes CLANGING down. As Filch
wheels, Harry strolls past.

111 EXT. GROUNDS/HOGWARTS CASTLE – DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 111

TWO AURORS, twin SILHOUETTES, patrol the grounds. Harry
approaches, about to intersect their paths when, at the
last second, something on the ground catches his eye. He
KNEELS, considers a BEETLE on its back, legs churning
helplessly. Harry extends his finger, letting the tiny
bug gain purchase, then tips it upright…
(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 105A.
111 CONTINUED: 111
…just as the Aurors’ SHADOWS quiver over him and
vanish. Rising, Harry starts off in one direction, then
stops, as if compelled by some inner voice, and heads the
opposite way.

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 106.

112 EXT. GREENHOUSE – DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 112

Harry HUMS placidly. Up ahead, a FIGURE ripples beyond
the steamy panes of the Greenhouse. It’s Slughorn,
hunched over a PLANT whose TENDRILS coil eerily,
resisting his attentions. Snip! He stealthily removes a
sprig, looks up and JUMPS.

SLUGHORN
Merlin’s beard, Harry!

HARRY
Sorry, sir. I should’ve announced
myself. Cleared my throat.
Coughed. You probably feared I
was Madam Sprout.
SLUGHORN
Well, yes, actually –
(paranoid)
Why would you think that?

HARRY
Just the general behavior, sir.
The sneaking around. The jumping
when you saw me. By the way,
those Tentacula leaves — they’re
quite valuable, aren’t they?

SLUGHORN
Ten galleons a leaf to the right
buyer — not that I’m familiar
with such back alley transactions.
One hears rumors is all. My own
interests are purely academic, of
course.
HARRY
Personally, these plants have
always kind of freaked me out.

Harry gives a little SHIVER of the shoulders, smiles.
Slughorn cocks his head, studies him oddly.

SLUGHORN
Exactly how did you get out of the
castle, Harry?

HARRY
Through the front doors, sir. I’m
off to Hagrid’s, you see. He’s a
very dear friend and I felt like
paying him a visit. So if you
don’t mind, I’ll be going.

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 107.
112 CONTINUED: 112
SLUGHORN
Harry!

HARRY
Sir?

SLUGHORN
It’s nearly nightfall. Surely you
realize I can’t allow you to roam
the grounds all by yourself.

HARRY
Well, then by all means come
along, sir.

113 EXT. HAGRID’S HUT – DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 113
Harry appears over a rise, strolling happily along…
when Slughorn appears, huffing and puffing to keep up.

SLUGHORN
Harry, I must insist you accompany
me back to the castle immediately!

HARRY
That would be counterproductive,
sir.

SLUGHORN
And what makes you say that?

HARRY
No idea.

Slughorn frowns impatiently — then stops, blinks.
SLUGHORN
Merlin’s beard…

Up ahead, Hagrid sits disconsolately upon a stump.
Nearby, Aragog’s massive body lies legs up.

SLUGHORN
Is that an actual Acromantula?

HARRY
A dead one, I think, sir.

NEW ANGLE – SECONDS LATER

Harry and Slughorn approach a sullen Hagrid.

(CONTINUED)

108.
113 CONTINUED: 113
HAGRID
`Arry. `Orace.

SLUGHORN
My god, dear man. How did you
ever manage to kill it?

HAGRID
Kill `im! Me oldest friend, `e
was!

SLUGHORN
I’m sorry, I… (didn’t realize.)

Slughorn falters helplessly. Hagrid waves his hand.

HAGRID
Ah, don’ worry yerself. Yer not
alone. Seriously misunderstood
creatures — spiders. It’s the
eyes, I reckon. Unnerve people.

HARRY
Not to mention the pincers.

Harry makes a little claw motion with his hand, while
making a CLICKING sound. Hagrid eyes Harry curiously.

HAGRID
I reckon that too… How’d yeh get
outta the castle anyways?

HARRY
Through the front doors.

SLUGHORN
Hagrid. I wouldn’t want to be
indelicate, but Acromantula venom
is uncommonly rare and, well, if
you wouldn’t mind my extracting a
vial or two — purely for academic
pursuits…

HAGRID
Don’ suppose it’s doin’ `im any
good, izzit?

SLUGHORN
My thoughts exactly! Always carry
a few spare ampoules for just such
occasions. Old Potion Master’s
habit, you know…

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 108A.
113 CONTINUED: (2) 113
Slughorn rummages about his pockets, extracts some SMALL
VIALS — all empty save for one containing a HAIRY WORM –
then scrambles up close to Aragog. Harry and Hagrid
watch.

HAGRID
Wish yeh coulda seen `im in `is
prime. Magnificent `e was. Jus’
magnificent…

Hagrid BLINKS wildly, then takes out a handkerchief and
SNORTS LOUDLY into it. Slughorn looks up, studies
Hagrid’s sorry expression with empathy and steps away.

SLUGHORN
Why don’t I say a few words? I
trust he had family?
HARRY
Oh yeah.

SLUGHORN
(clearing his throat)
Farewell…

Slughorn frowns.

HAGRID
Aragog.

SLUGHORN
(a nod)
Farewell, Aragog, king of
arachnids. Though your body will
decay, your spirit lingers on in
the quiet, web-spun places of your
Forest home. May your many-eyed
descendents ever flourish and your
human friends find solace for the
loss they have sustained.

HAGRID
Tha’ was… tha’ was… beautiful.

Hagrid wipes his eyes, then rises. He walks to Aragog,
studies him lovingly, then puts a shoulder to the big
beast’s body… and sends him tumbling into the freshly-
dug grave adjacent with a SICKENING THUNK.

HAGRID/SLUGHORN (O.S.)
(singing)
And Odo the hero, they bore him
back home…

109.

114 INT. HAGRID’S HUT – NIGHT (HOURS LATER) 114

Harry, Hagrid and Slughorn sit at the massive kitchen
table, which is strewn with EMPTY WINE BOTTLES. Hagrid
and Slughorn are feeling no pain, while Harry looks clear-
eyed, focused.

HAGRID/SLUGHORN
To the place he’d known as a lad,
They laid him to rest with his hat
inside out and his wand snapped in
two, which was sad…
As they finish, both men CHUCKLE. Hagrid tops off
everyone’s mug with a bit more wine. Harry brings his
mug to his lap… then slyly pours it into the bucket at
his feet.
HAGRID
I had `im from an egg, yeh know.
Tiny little thing he was when he
hatched. No bigger’n a Pekinese.

SLUGHORN
Sweet. I once had a fish.
Francis. Lovely little thing.
One day I came downstairs and he’d
vanished. Poof.

HAGRID
Tha’s odd.

SLUGHORN
Isn’t it? That’s life, I suppose.
One goes along and then… poof.
HAGRID
Poof.

HARRY
Poof.

They all nod soberly. Slughorn’s eyes rise to the
ceiling.

SLUGHORN
That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?

Hagrid looks up, reels a bit. Nods.

SLUGHORN
But my dear chap, do you know how
much that’s worth?

(CONTINUED)

110.
114 CONTINUED: 114
HAGRID
No idea… no idea at all…

Thunk! Hagrid’s great shaggy head hits the table.
Instantly, he is SNORING, so DEEPLY his MUG shimmies
across the table. Slughorn smiles, regards Harry, who
merely stares back. Slughorn averts his eyes. Suddenly
nervous. A WIND rises outside. Windowpanes rattle.

SLUGHORN
It was a student who gave me
Francis. One spring afternoon I
discovered a bowl upon my desk
with a few inches of clear water.
There was a flower petal floating
upon the surface. As I watched,
the petal sank, but just before it
touched bottom… it transformed.
Into a wee fish. It was beautiful
magic, wondrous to behold. The
petal had come from a lily.

Hearing “lily,” Harry looks up. Slughorn nods.

SLUGHORN
Your mother. The day I came
downstairs, the day I found the
bowl empty… was the day she…

Slughorn falters, pain etching his face.

SLUGHORN
I know what you want. But I can’t
give it to you. It will ruin
me…
Harry studies Slughorn a moment, thinking, then speaks.

HARRY
Do you know why I survived? The
night I got this.

Slughorn looks up, sees Harry pointing to his scar.

HARRY
Because of her. Because she
sacrificed herself. Because she
refused to step aside. Because
her love was more powerful than
Voldemort.

SLUGHORN
Please don’t say his –

(CONTINUED)

111.
114 CONTINUED: (2) 114
HARRY
I’m not afraid of the name,
Professor. And I’m not afraid of
him. And you shouldn’t be either.
She didn’t just die for me that
night. She died for you too. She
died for everyone who’s ever woken
in the middle of the night afraid
a Death Eater waited on their
doorstep.

Slughorn gazes into the guttering candle before him.

HARRY
Professor. I’m going to tell you
something, something others have
only guessed at. It’s true. I am
the Chosen One.

Slughorn looks up. Harry nods.

HARRY
Only I can kill him. But in order
to do so, I need to know what Tom
Riddle asked you that night in
your office all those years ago.
And I need to know what you told
him.

Slughorn’s eyes well with tears, his hands tremble.

HARRY
Be brave, Professor. Be brave
like my mother. Otherwise you
disgrace her. Otherwise she died
for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl
remains empty forever.

Slughorn shakes his head, staring into the candle.
Finally, slowly, he removes his wand.

SLUGHORN
Don’t think too badly of me once
you’ve seen it. You don’t know
what he was like… even then.

Slughorn fishes out a tiny vial — the one with the WORM
– but his hand is shaking so violently, Harry has to
take it. Slowly, Slughorn raises his wand, touches it to
his temple and withdraws a LONG, SILVER THREAD. Harry
extends the vial and… it drops within.

112.

115 INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE – NIGHT 115

Dumbledore holds the vial in wonderment. The worm hangs
in eerie suspension.

DUMBLEDORE
How is he? Horace?

Harry shrugs. Dumbledore nods, then tips his hand. A
LONG strand hangs suspended like glass. A pearl forms…
and as it hangs… Harry’s eyes shift, notice a DRAWING
on Dumbledore’s desk, one of Tom Riddle’s drawings seen
at the orphanage, of the CAVE and the distinct
OUTCROPPING. Then… the pearl drops.

116 FLASHBACK – INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE – NIGHT (YEARS PAST) 116
As before. The CRACKLING EMBERS of the FIRE. Slughorn,
a circle of six. Riddle commanding the room.

TOM RIDDLE
Sir, is it true that Professor
Merrythought is retiring?

Slughorn chuckles, wags a sugar-encrusted finger at
Riddle.

SLUGHORN
Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I
knew, could I? I must say, m’boy,
I’d like to know where you get
your information. More
knowledgable than half the staff,
you are.
(as the other boys
laugh)
By the way, thank you for the
pineapple — you’re quite right,
it is my favorite — how is it you
knew?

TOM RIDDLE
Intuition.

SLUGHORN
(an uneasy chuckle)
Good gracious, is it that time
already? Off you go, boys, or
Professor Dippett will have us all
in detention. Lestrange, Avery,
don’t forget your essays…

The others exit, when — PING! — Slughorn turns, eyes
the hourglass, finds Tom Riddle still there.
(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 113.
116 CONTINUED: 116
SLUGHORN
Look sharp, Tom. You don’t want
to be caught out of bed after
hours…

TOM RIDDLE
I know a secret shortcut or two.

SLUGHORN
Yes, I imagine you do. Something
on your mind, Tom?

TOM RIDDLE
Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of
anyone else to go to. The other
Professors, well, they’re not like
you. They might… misunderstand.
SLUGHORN
Go on.

TOM RIDDLE
I was in the library the other
night, in the Restricted section,
and I read something rather odd,
about a bit of rare magic and I
thought perhaps you could
illuminate me. It’s called, as I
understand it… a Horcrux.

Slughorn’s weak smile evaporates altogether.

SLUGHORN
Excuse me?

TOM RIDDLE
Horcrux. I came across the term
while reading and I didn’t fully
understand it.

SLUGHORN
I’m not sure what you were
reading, Tom, but that’s very Dark
stuff, very Dark indeed.

TOM RIDDLE
Yes, sir. Which is why I came to
you. I mean no disrespect to the
rest of the staff, but I thought
if anyone could tell me… it
would be you.

Slughorn frowns, clearly disturbed, then speaks quietly.

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 114.
116 CONTINUED: (2) 116
SLUGHORN
A Horcrux is an object in which a
person has concealed part of their
soul.

TOM RIDDLE
Yes, I thought it might be
something like that. But I don’t
understand how that works, sir.

SLUGHORN
One splits one’s soul and hides
part of it in an object. By doing
so, you are protected should you
be attacked and your body
destroyed.
TOM RIDDLE
Protected?

SLUGHORN
That part of your soul that was
hidden, lives on. In other words,
you cannot die.

Riddle nods and TURNS AWAY, staring at himself in the
MIRROR on the wall opposite. A hint of RED glints in his
eyes.

TOM RIDDLE
How does one split his soul, sir?

SLUGHORN
I think you can guess the answer
to that, Tom.
TOM RIDDLE
Murder.

SLUGHORN
Yes. Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.
After, one is never the same.

TOM RIDDLE
Out of curiosity, sir — can you
only split your soul once? For
instance, isn’t seven the most
powerfully magical number –

SLUGHORN
Seven! Merlin’s beard, Tom!
Isn’t it bad enough to think of
killing one person? To rip the
soul into seven pieces…

SLUGHORN (CONT’D)
(stopping; worried)
This is all hypothetical, isn’t
it, Tom? All academic…

TOM RIDDLE
Of course, sir. And I promise
I’ll not speak of our
conversation. It’ll be our little
secret…

Riddle reaches out then and pinches the FLAME of a
candle, killing it. As SMOKE RISES, we –

DISSOLVE INTO:

117 INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE – SAME TIME – NIGHT (PRESENT) 117
… the surface of the Pensieve, where Riddle quivers.
We RACK FOCUS and Dumbledore’s troubled face bleeds
through Riddle’s.

HARRY
Sir –

Dumbledore holds up his withered hand, silencing him,
turns away. Harry studies him, waiting, the hush
palpable.

DUMBLEDORE
(haunted)
This is beyond anything I
imagined. In my life I have seen
things that are unimaginably
horrific. I know now… you will
see worse.
Dumbledore looks off, his eyes distant. Harry watches
him intently, as do the HEADMASTERS in their frames
above. Finally, tentatively, Harry speaks.

HARRY
Do you mean to say he succeeded,
sir? In making a Horcrux?

DUMBLEDORE
Oh he succeeded. And not just
once. Think, Harry. He’s just
told us.

HARRY
Seven. He made seven — the most
powerfully magical number. But…
what are they exactly?

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 116.
117 CONTINUED: 117
DUMBLEDORE
They can be anything. The most
commonplace of objects. A ring,
for example. Or a book…

Dumbledore slides open a drawer, removes the RING and Tom
Riddle’s battered DIARY.

HARRY
Tom Riddle’s diary –

DUMBLEDORE
It’s a Horcrux, yes. Four years
ago, when you saved Ginny
Weasley’s life in the Chamber of
Secrets, when you brought me
this –
(holding up the
diary)
I knew. This was a different kind
of magic. Very dark. Very
powerful. But until tonight, I
had no idea just how powerful…

HARRY
And the ring…?

DUMBLEDORE
Belonged to Voldemort’s mother.
It was difficult to find and…
(raising his damaged
hand)
… even more difficult to
destroy.

HARRY
But if you could find them all.
If you did destroy each Horcrux…

DUMBLEDORE
One destroys Voldemort.

Harry begins to reach out for the ring…

HARRY
But how would you find them? They
could be hidden anywhere, couldn’t
they…

DUMBLEDORE
True. But magic, especially Dark
magic…

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 117.
117 CONTINUED: (2) 117
Just then, as the flash of Harry’s fingers make contact
with the ring, IMAGES FLASH by in DIZZYING succession:
VOLDEMORT’S FACE, twisted in pain. A DERELICT HOUSE,
deep in a haunted clearing. An ANCIENT CUP, gleaming as
it tumbles from an old woman’s hand. A SNAKE (NAGINI)
slithering through damp grass. Dumbledore slipping the
ring onto his finger, recoiling as his skin decays…

DUMBLEDORE
… leaves traces.

Harry’s clenched hand SPASMS, RELEASES. The ring
skitters across Dumbledore’s desk and Harry brings a hand
to his chest, a look of bewilderment on his face.
Dumbledore watches the ring spin down, then glances at
Harry and slowly extends his own hand, lightly touching
the center of Harry’s chest with the tips of ashen
fingers, as if reading braille, as if he can somehow
“see” into Harry’s heart. Trepidation — and recognition
– flicker over his face.

HARRY
It’s where you’ve been going,
isn’t it, sir? When you leave the
school.

Harry’s eyes drift once again to the postcard on the
desk. Dumbledore withdraws his hand, nodding, still
studying Harry oddly, his voice, when it comes, distant.

DUMBLEDORE
Yes. And I think… perhaps… I
may have found another. But this
time I cannot hope to destroy it
alone.
Harry peers into Dumbledore’s eyes. Dumbledore nods.

DUMBLEDORE
Once again, I shall ask too much
of you.

118 INT./EXT. GARGOYLE CORRIDOR – LATE DAY 118

Harry stands at a window, looking out. He brings his
fingers to his chest again when… Hermione comes up
behind him.

HERMIONE
Harry. It’s time.

118.

119 INT./EXT. COURTYARD – LATE DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 119

Harry, Hermione and Ron walk.

HARRY
Hermione, is the Room of
Requirement unplottable?

HERMIONE
If one wants it to be. Why?

HARRY
It would explain why I thought
Malfoy was leaving the castle when
he disappeared off the Map.

HARRY
He was going to the Room of
Requirement.

HERMIONE
Of course, and that explains the
Vanishing Cabinet as well!

RON
No. I got an owl from Dad this
morning. The one at Borgin &
Burke’s? It’s still there.

HARRY
But I’m telling you. I saw it –

Just then, the twins appear, pass. Harry watches them, a
thought forming.

HARRY
What if there are two? Vanishing
cabinets.

HERMIONE
What if there are?

HARRY
I don’t know…

Harry watches the twins vanish around a corner.

RON
Good luck, mate.

Harry turns back to Ron and Hermione, neither able to
fully conceal heir concern. He smiles reassuringly,

119 CONTINUED: 119
HARRY
I don’t need luck. I’ll be with
Dumbledore.

120 EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER – DYING LIGHT (LATER) 120

As Harry trots up the spiraling exterior stairs, he hears
VOICES coming from the topmost level and pauses, peering
up through the grid-like floor above: Dumbledore and
Snape.

SNAPE
Have you ever considered that you
ask too much? That you take too
much for granted? Has it ever
crossed your brilliant mind that I
don’t want to do this anymore?

DUMBLEDORE
Whether it has or hasn’t is
irrelevant. I will not negotiate
this with you, Severus. You
agreed. There’s nothing more to
discuss.

Harry stands poised, peering upward, where Dumbledore
squints toward the dying sun and Snape glares at his
back. Finally, Snape turns away and — before Harry can
react — is descending the stairs. Seeing Harry, Snape
falters briefly, then continues on without a word. As
his FOOTSTEPS fade, Harry ascends to the upper tier.
Dumbledore turns. Smiles.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry. You need a shave, my
friend.

Harry runs his hand over his face.

DUMBLEDORE
At times I forget how much you’ve
grown. At times I still see the
small boy from the cupboard.
(smiling)
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. I
am an old man.

HARRY
You look the same to me, sir.

DUMBLEDORE
Like your mother, you are
unfailingly kind.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

120.
120 CONTINUED: 120
DUMBLEDORE (CONT’D)
A trait people never fail to
undervalue. I’m afraid.

Dumbledore turns then, eyes the fiery sky again.

DUMBLEDORE
The place to which we journey
tonight is exceedingly dangerous,
Harry. I promised that you could
accompany me and I stand by that
promise. But there is a
condition: You must obey any
command I give you — without
question.

HARRY
Yes, sir.
DUMBLEDORE
Understand what I’m saying.
Should I tell you to hide, you
must hide.

Harry nods.

DUMBLEDORE
Should I tell you to run, you will
run.

Harry nods.

DUMBLEDORE
And should I tell you to abandon
me and save yourself…

Harry’s eyes rise, meet Dumbledore’s.
DUMBLEDORE
You will do so.

Harry hesitates.

DUMBLEDORE
Your word, Harry.

Harry debates this internally, then, finally, nods.

HARRY
My word.

DUMBLEDORE
Take my arm.

(CONTINUED)

120A.
120 CONTINUED: (2) 120
HARRY
Sir, I thought one couldn’t
Apparate within Hogwarts.

DUMBLEDORE
Being me has its privileges.

The WIND GUSTS and Harry reaches out. Dumbledore’s CLOAK
BILLOWS and we are TOSSED INTO…

121 EXT. OCEAN – DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 121

BLACK. Undulating. The sound of WAVES. We EASE UP, out
of the ocean. A GIANT WAVE crashes over a jagged
outcropping. As the SPRAY clears… Dumbledore and Harry
are revealed. Dumbledore eyes the TOWERING CLIFF FACE
opposite, the CAVE.

HARRY
It’s there, isn’t it?

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 121.

122 EXT. CAVE – SAME TIME – DUSK 122

Harry and Dumbledore materialize. It is quiet here,
eerily so, the waves merely distant thunder. As Harry
glances about, Dumbledore moves to an archway, passes
beyond. Harry follows, finds Dumbledore standing below a
towering dome of rock, probing its mysteries with the
light from his wand.

DUMBLEDORE
This is the place. Oh yes, this
place has known magic.
(closing his eyes)
Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle
once stood many, many years ago,
when he was but a poor orphan boy
with a penchant for cruelty…
Dumbledore’s wand stops briefly in its arc and his face
registers pain, as if detecting some past unpleasantry.
He begins to TRACE HIS FINGERS over the surface of the
rock.

DUMBLEDORE
One wintry afternoon, he lured two
younger classmates to this cave.
What happened is unclear. But
this much is known: the children
were damaged.

Dumbledore begins to MURMUR in a STRANGE WHISPER as his
fingers play over the rock… then stop. His eyes open.
He takes a dagger from his robes and draws the blade
across his forearm, speckling the rock face with scarlet
beads.
HARRY
Sir!
The rock face SIZZLES like acid and begins to crumble,
forming a narrow opening.

DUMBLEDORE
In order to gain passage, payment
must be made, payment intended to
weaken any intruder.

HARRY
You should’ve let me, sir.

DUMBLEDORE
Oh, no, Harry. Your blood is much
more precious than mine.

122.

123 EXT. ARCHWAY/UNDERGROUND LAKE – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 123

Dumbledore and Harry emerge onto the rim of a VAST LAKE
teeming with MIST. A chill hangs in the air.

DUMBLEDORE
Careful. The water.

Harry peers into the lake. It is black as ink.

NEW ANGLE – MOMENTS LATER

Harry follows Dumbledore around the rim of the lake. In
the center, a GREENISH GLOW shimmers in the mist.

DUMBLEDORE
It’s there. The only question is
how do we get to it?

HARRY
We couldn’t, perhaps, just try a
Summoning Charm, sir?

Dumbledore smiles, motions: Be my guest. Harry lifts
his wand.

HARRY
Accio Horcrux!
There is an EXPLOSION and something PALE erupts out of
the water. Harry nearly sheds his skin. Dumbledore
calmly watches it VANISH beneath the surface.

DUMBLEDORE
Perhaps not.

NEW ANGLE – MOMENTS LATER

Dumbledore leads Harry on. Stops. Takes a step back.
He CLOSES HIS EYES and to Harry’s horror walks right to
the lake’s edge. As the dark water laps over the toes of
his shoes, Dumbledore PASSES HIS HAND slowly through the
air, then closes it… as if gripping something
invisible. Taking his wand, he gives his CLENCHED FIST a
TAP and a thick coppery-green CHAIN appears out of thin
air, extending from the water to Dumbledore’s hand.

DUMBLEDORE
If you would, Harry…

Quickly Harry grasps the end of the chain and together he
and Dumbledore pull, end over end, until the PROW of a
SMALL BOAT pierces the surface, green with algae.
(CONTINUED)

123.
123 CONTINUED: 123
NEW ANGLE – MOMENTS LATER

In eerie silence, the boat cleaves the water, ferrying
Harry and Dumbledore toward the GREENISH GLOW.

HARRY
Sir… have you ever taken Felix
Felicis?
DUMBLEDORE
Only recreationally. You see, I
believe one creates one’s own
luck.

Harry looks down into the water, watches a FACE skim by
beneath the surface.
HARRY
Professor… there are bodies in
this lake.

DUMBLEDORE
Yes.

NEW ANGLE (SMALL ISLAND) – MOMENTS LATER

Here the GREENISH GLOW is ferocious. As the boat
arrives, Dumbledore steps out.

DUMBLEDORE
Remember… the water.

Harry nods, steps out carefully and joins Dumbledore at
the source of the GLOW — a BASIN filled with a
PHOSPHORESCENT LIQUID. Dumbledore extends the tips of
his blackened fingers toward the basin, but cannot touch
the liquid.

HARRY
Do you think the Horcrux is in
there, sir?

DUMBLEDORE
Oh yes.

Dumbledore steps back, ponders the basin. Notes the
CRYSTAL GOBLET sitting beside it. Smiles ruefully.

DUMBLEDORE
It has to be drunk.
(as Harry reacts)
You remember the condition on
which I brought you with me?

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 124.
123 CONTINUED: (2) 123
Harry starts to respond. Stops. Nods.

DUMBLEDORE
This potion might paralyze me. It
might cause me to forget why I’m
here. It might create so much
pain I beg for relief. You are
not to indulge these requests,
Harry. It is your job to make
sure I keep drinking this potion
even if you have to force it down
my throat. Understood?

HARRY
Why can’t I drink it, sir?

DUMBLEDORE
Because I am much older, much
cleverer… and much less
valuable.
(taking the goblet)
Your good health, Harry.

Dumbledore dips the goblet into the gleaming liquid and
brings it to his lips. Drinks deep. Closes his eyes.

HARRY
Professor?

Dumbledore shakes his head, silencing Harry, then dips
the goblet once more. Twice more he drinks. His hand
TREMBLES and he grips the side of the basin.

HARRY
Professor? Can you hear me?
Dumbledore says nothing. The corners of his eyes TWITCH.
His hand TREMBLES, savagely this time, and he nearly
drops the goblet. Harry reaches out, steadies his hand.

DUMBLEDORE
Don’t… don’t make me…

Harry eyes Dumbledore’s anguished face, steels himself.

HARRY
You… you can’t stop, Professor.
You’ve got to keep drinking. Like
you said. Remember.

DUMBLEDORE
Nooooooo!!!

(CONTINUED)

125.
123 CONTINUED: (3) 123
Harry staggers back, so primal is Dumbledore’s plea.
Dumbledore’s arm goes slack, the goblet clanging dully
against the side of the basin. Harry takes a breath,
steps forward, places his hand over Dumbledore’s, lifts
the cup.

DUMBLEDORE
Make it stop… Please… make it
stop…

HARRY
It will, sir. It’ll stop. But
only if you drink…

Harry, his own hand TREMBLING now, tips the goblet over
Dumbledore’s lips.
DUMBLEDORE
My fault. It’s all my fault…

Harry brings the goblet up once more. Dumbledore drinks.

DUMBLEDORE
Too much… I can’t… take it…
I want… to die… kill… kill
me… KILL ME, HARRY!

HARRY
What?

DUMBLEDORE
Your word, Harry! Your word!

HARRY
No…
DUMBLEDORE
KILL ME! IT’S THE ONLY WAY!
Harry stands paralyzed, unsure what to do. Then…
Dumbledore collapses, rolls onto his back. Harry pelts
forward, dips the goblet into the basin and kneels by
Dumbledore.

HARRY
One more. Just one more. And
then — I promise… I’ll do what
you say.

Dumbledore, jaw clinched shut, eyes Harry.

HARRY
I promise.

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 126.
123 CONTINUED: (4) 123
Dumbledore’s jaw relaxes and Harry pries open his mouth,
tips the liquid down his throat. Pain ripples through
Dumbledore’s face. He tries to speak, Harry eyeing him
with trepidation, fearful of what he will request. Again
and again Dumbledore struggles and then… his eyes…
open. Find Harry.

DUMBLEDORE
Water.

A shudder of relief goes through Harry. Grinning, he
leaps to the basin. A GOLDEN LOCKET now lies at the
bottom. Harry snatches it up.

DUMBLEDORE
Water…
HARRY
Aguamenti.
Instantly COLD CLEAR WATER rises in the basin.

HARRY
You did it, sir. Look –

Harry frowns. The goblet is empty.

DUMBLEDORE
Water!
Harry dips the goblet into the basin yet again, brings it
to Dumbledore’s lips… but once again finds it empty.
Dumbledore tries to speak, but his lips are CRACKING, his
tongue like SAND. He GULPS DRILY for air.

HARRY
I’m trying, sir. I’m –

Harry stops. All is silent… except for the SOFT
LAPPING of the lake. He considers the GHOSTLY SHAPES
gliding just below the surface. Deciding, he dips the
goblet into the dark water. Instantly, the lake begins
to CHURN. Harry backs away, the goblet sloshing in his
hand. FACES, pale and haunted, quiver in the roiling
water.

Harry tips the water into Dumbledore’s mouth. Dumbledore
blinks. His tongue probes his lower lip. Harry returns
to the water’s edge, hesitates, then plunges the goblet
into water once more. Instantly, a SLIMY WHITE HAND
snags his wrist and Harry is pulled under. The goblet
bobs on the surface.

(CONTINUED)

127.
123 CONTINUED: (5) 123
NEW ANGLE – UNDERWATER

Utterly silent. Harry twists madly as HANDS reach for
him, turning him this way and that. HAUNTED FACES float
by.

NEW ANGLE – THE SURFACE

Harry breaks the surface, GASPING for air, blinking,
catching a glimpse of Dumbledore slumped against the
basin as he is…

NEW ANGLE – UNDERWATER

… pulled underwater once again, into the eerie SILENCE
of flailing arms. He shakes free again and again, but
there are too many hands, too many haunted faces. We
STAY UNDER a very long time, feel his lungs burning. His
eyes lose their focus, turning blank. Bubbles trail out
of his mouth as his face goes slack. He sinks deeper, in
free fall, takes one last look at the SHIMMERING SURFACE
ABOVE, the last thing he will see… when a SHADOW
SHIVERS briefly and…

… the SURFACE SIZZLES with RED LIGHT, like blood, then
becomes TRANSPARENT, revealing DUMBLEDORE, wand pointed
directly at the water.

NEW ANGLE – THE SURFACE

Harry breaks the surface, SPITTING UP WATER, GASPING FOR
AIR. Dumbledore staggers, slumps once more against the
basin, weakened by his effort. Harry scrambles up,
steadies him and the lake EXPLODES WITH FIRE. Harry
wheels, watches the bodies in the lake twist in pain.

DUMBLEDORE
Go…

Harry turns, confused. Dumbledore’s hand finds his face.

DUMBLEDORE
We have to… go.

Harry glances to the boat. Flames lick the prow,
darkening the wood, but do not destroy it. He nods.

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 128.

124 EXT. CAVE – ENTRANCE 124

Harry and Dumbledore emerge from the cave. Dumbledore,
pale and weak, scans the stars wearily, leans heavily on
Harry.

HARRY
Don’t worry, sir. We’re nearly
there.

DUMBLEDORE
I am not worried, Harry. I am
with you.

A CHOIR IN FULL VOICE RISES ON THE AIR and we –

CUT TO:

125 INT. GREAT HALL – SAME TIME – NIGHT 125

We HOLD ON the Gothic glass of the main window. Ambient
light, ominous and cool, plays across its shimmering
surface. Flitwick, arms flowing gracefully, conducts a
group of FIFTH YEARS, looks up toward the window, eyes
the pulsating light.

126 EXT. COURTYARD – SAME TIME – NIGHT 126

McGonagall stands in the courtyard as the CHOIR DRIFTS
FAINTLY on the night air. She glances up to the sky, a
curious expression on her face, then spies a pair of
First Years straggling across the courtyard.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
To your Houses. No dawdling.

As they scuttle off, McGonagall looks back to the sky. A
VORTEX of CLOUDS swirls eerily in on itself. We PULL
BACK…

127 INT. CASTLE – WINDOW – SAME TIME – NIGHT 127

… out of a window, its glass prickling with ambient
light, and find Snape standing silently, staring at the
gathering storm, his expression inscrutable. The choir a
murmur.

129.

128 INT. COMMON ROOM – SAME TIME – NIGHT 128

Darker than usual. The fire muted. Ron and Hermione sit
together. Silent. Glance toward the window, the sky
beyond.

129 INT. HOSPITAL WING – SAME TIME – NIGHT 129

Draco’s face, skin glimmering with the light crawling
across the ceiling above him. He stares, unblinking,
swings out of the bed. Bare feet — Draco’s — drop to
the tiles.

130 INT. CORRIDOR – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 130
The choir echoes eerily. SIXTH YEARS, little more than
SHADOWS, hang out, giggling in dark corners. Malfoy
glides by in his bare feet. Unnoticed. A ghost.

131 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 131

Dense with shadow. Strange slashes of light. Malfoy, a
shadow within shadows, pulls the tapestry from the
Vanishing Cabinet, steps back…

He stares at the monolith before him, lifts his wand and
begins to CHANT eerily. The surface of the cabinet
glimmers, atremble in the ambient light. Almost alive.
Then he stops. Looking back, his eyes haunted, he slips
away.

Light plays within the cabinet. Movement. Shadows
flicker within, coalesce. We ease up, reveal…
Bellatrix. Greyback. And a few friends. Bellatrix
steps into the light. Glances around. Grins.

132 EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER – NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 132

Harry and Dumbledore materialize on the rooftop.
Dumbledore glances above, notes the clouds.

HARRY
We need to get you up to the
hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey –

DUMBLEDORE
No. Severus… Severus is who I
need… Go and wake him… Tell
him what has happened…

DUMBLEDORE (CONT’D)
Speak to no one else… I… I
shall wait here…

HARRY
All right. Okay.

Harry gently disengages from Dumbledore, leaves him
leaning against the ramparts. He dashes to the stairwell
door and, glancing back, sees Dumbledore MUTTERING
WEARILY as he GESTICULATES with his blackened hand.

HARRY
Sir, are you… praying?

DUMBLEDORE
(smiling faintly)
No, Harry. I do not pray. I was
merely closing a window — the one
that had allowed us to Apparate.

Harry nods, begins to open the door, when FOOTSTEPS
sound. Draws his wand. Dumbledore cocks his head,
listening. Wincing, he straightens up, as if to mask his
infirmity.

DUMBLEDORE
Hide yourself below. And do not
speak or show yourself without my
permission. No matter what.

Harry looks down, through the LATTICEWORK at his feet, to
the tier below. The FOOTSTEPS DRAW CLOSER.

DUMBLEDORE
Do as I say, Harry.
Harry hesitates. Dumbledore’s eyes blaze…

DUMBLEDORE
Trust me.
Harry meets Dumbledore’s eyes, then pockets his wand and
slips down the stairs. As he reaches the level below,
the DOOR above FLIES OPEN. Harry peers up through the
grid, watches Malfoy come INTO VIEW.

DUMBLEDORE
Good evening, Draco. What brings
you out on such a fine Spring
evening? Or is it Summer?

Draco stands poised, wand in hand, eyes darting about.

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 131.
132 CONTINUED: (2) 132
MALFOY
Who else is here? I heard you
talking.

DUMBLEDORE
I often talk aloud to myself. I
find it extraordinarily useful.
That which sounds sane at a
whisper can seem utterly mad when
said for all the world to hear.
Haven’t been whispering to
yourself, have you, Draco?

Draco eyes Dumbledore with unease.

DUMBLEDORE
You are not an assassin, Draco.
MALFOY
How do you know what I am? I’ve
done things that would shock you.

DUMBLEDORE
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping
she would, in turn, bear a cursed
necklace to me? Like replacing a
bottle of mead with one laced with
poison. Forgive me, Draco, but
these are attempts so feeble I
cannot help but question if your
heart has been really in them.
I’m curious. When Voldemort gave
you this task, when he asked you
to kill me, was it in a whisper?

MALFOY
He trusts me! I was chosen!

Malfoy thrusts out his arm, pulls back his sleeve and
reveals the DARK MARK. Dumbledore barely looks at it.

DUMBLEDORE
Then I shall make it easy for you.

Slowly and without intent, Dumbledore draws his wand.
Instantly Malfoy raises his own.

MALFOY

Expelliarumus!
Harry watches in horror as Dumbledore’s wand flies free,
clattering across the grid above. Malfoy watches it roll
to a stop, a curious mixture of fear and awe at his own
actions. Dumbledore eyes the wand, then Draco.

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 131A.

Killing is not nearly as easy.

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 132.
132 CONTINUED: (4) 132
Malfoy looks into Dumbledore’s eyes, then to the sky, at
the gathering clouds, twisting darkly, then glances to
the stairwell. Dumbledore notices.

DUMBLEDORE
You’re not alone. Are you. There
are others. How?

A sneering smile plays over Malfoy’s lips.

MALFOY
The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room
of Requirement.

DUMBLEDORE
That cabinet has been broken for
years.
MALFOY
I’ve been mending it.

DUMBLEDORE
Ingenious. Let me guess. It has
a sister. A twin.

MALFOY
In Borgin & Burkes. They form –

DUMBLEDORE
A passage, yes. Very good.
(eyes shifting)
I once knew a boy years ago who
made all the wrong choices. Let
me help you, Draco.

MALFOY
I don’t want your help! Don’t you
see! I have to do it! I have to!
(in a whisper)
I’ve got to kill you or he’ll kill
me.

DUMBLEDORE
Say that again, Draco. But aloud
this time.

Draco looks deep into Dumbledore’s eyes. His hand
trembles. Transfixed, Harry watches from the shadows.
Slowly, Malfoy begins to LOWER HIS WAND… when FOOTSTEPS
ECHO. The DOOR FLIES OPEN: Bellatrix, Greyback and the
others.

BELLATRIX
Well now, look what we have here.
Dumbledore. Wandless and alone.

BELLATRIX (CONT’D)
Cornered in his own castle. Well
done, Draco.

Harry peers up, eyes flashing angrily at the sound of
Bellatrix’s voice. He draws his wand slowly.

DUMBLEDORE
Good evening, Bellatrix. I think
introductions are in order.

BELLATRIX
Love to, Albus. But I’m afraid
we’re on a bit of a tight
schedule.
(to Malfoy)
Do it.
Malfoy’s wand rises once again. Harry raises his own,
aiming through the grid, poised. Just then, a SHADOW
splinters through the columns to his right. He looks,
finds Snape, quiet as a ghost, peering upward.
Carefully, Snape draws his wand, then turns to Harry, a
finger to his lips: Shhh. Then he is drifting upward.
Silent. A ghost again.

GREYBACK
He doesn’t have the stomach. Like
his father. Let me finish him.
In my own way.

BELLATRIX
No! The Dark Lord was clear. The
boy’s to do it. Go on, Draco.
Now!
Once again Draco raises his wand, his hand trembling.
Harry’s own arm is stiff, sure. The vein in his hand
pulsates…

SNAPE (O.S.)
No.

Harry watches Snape come INTO VIEW.

DUMBLEDORE
Severus…

BELLATRIX
Well, look who’s here. Hogwarts
own Defense Against the Dark Arts
teacher. Come to see the
slaughter?

DUMBLEDORE
Severus… please.

132 CONTINUED: (6) 132
SNAPE
I gave my word. I made a vow…

Harry’s eyes dart back and forth frantically, trying to
make sense of the scene playing out above. Snape’s arm
rises.

SNAPE
Avada Kedavra!
A JET of GREEN LIGHT hits Dumbledore squarely in the
chest. For a second he hangs, suspended upon the
ramparts, and then… the night swallows him.

HARRY SCREAMS in RAGE. Bellatrix raises her wand to the
sky and a DEAFENING BLAST shakes the castle, masking
Harry’s cry. The CLOUDS EXPLODE with GRIM LIGHT,
mutating into a SKULL. As the Death Eaters flee, Snape’s
arm drops limply to his side.

SNAPE
You can no longer stay here.

Draco, stunned, stares at the empty place where
Dumbledore stood only seconds before. Snape takes him by
the scruff of the neck, forces him through the door, then
follows.

Harry scrambles up the stairs and lurches to the
ramparts, BATHED IN THE GREEN LIGHT from above. He peers
down. Agony wrecks Harry’s face and he has to steady
himself. He looks up into the leering skull above. Rage
fills his eyes.

132A EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER – SAME TIME – NIGHT 132A
Snape leads Malfoy and Bellatrix down the spiraling
staircase.

132B INT. SLUGHORN’S CORRIDOR – NIGHT 132B

Snape leads on, his face a mask as he rounds a corner.
STUDENTS in pajamas and robes peer at the emerald sky,
then turn, stare curiously at their teacher and his
companions. Snape sweeps past wordlessly. Draco averts
his eyes. Bellatrix leers at a TINY FIRST YEAR, leans
close:

BELLATRIX
Boo.

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 134A.

132C INT. OUTSIDE GREAT HALL – NIGHT 132C

Hearing FOOTSTEPS, an AUROR turns, is BLASTED off his
feet as Snape and the others appear. Bellatrix lags,
then steps to the TOWERING DOORS of the Hall, peering
upward, past the FLOATING CANDLES to the vaulted ceiling,
solemn as a church. Raising her wand, she sends a FIERY
BOLT toward the GRAND WINDOW opposite. As it EXPLODES, a
BLAST of COLD AIR sweeps the room, EXTINGUISHING THE
CANDLES. Snape turns, looks back. Bellatrix simply
GRINS, a mad child.

132D INT. CORRIDOR – SAME TIME – NIGHT 132D

As Bellatrix’s BLAST ECHOES, Ron and Hermione — racing
side by side in their regular clothes — glance at one
another, dash on.

132E EXT. CASTLE – SAME TIME – NIGHT 132E

Filch, on guard, looks up, watches SHARDS OF GLASS spill
from the window like jewels, standing transfixed as the
fragments lash his face, draw blood.

132F INT. CORRIDOR – SAME TIME – NIGHT 132F

Harry races on, glances out a window and sees Snape and
the others racing across a lower courtyard.

132G EXT. LOWER COURTYARD – SAME TIME – NIGHT 132G

Malfoy slows, glancing upward, watching the students come
to the windows and peer out at the emerald sky. They
look like ghosts in their nightclothes.

BELLATRIX
Draco! Draco!
(as he turns)
They’ll kill you if you stay.

132H INT. CORRIDOR – SAME TIME – NIGHT 132H

Hermione and Ron push through the other students, who are
confused, crying. McGonagall appears, meets Ron and
Hermione’s glance, continues on.

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 134B.

132I EXT. HAGRID’S HUT/GROUNDS – SAME TIME – NIGHT 132I

Quiet here. A VIEW TOWARD the castle. We HOLD. Slowly
FIGURES appear on the horizon. The Death Eaters.
Greyback. Bellatrix, Draco. And Snape.

133 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE – NIGHT 133

Harry bursts through the entrance doors, wand in hand.
Before him, the grounds shimmer eerily in the GREEN GLOW.
He sees the FIGURES FLEEING towards Hagrid’s Hut.

134 EXT. HAGRID’S HUT / GROUNDS – SAME TIME – NIGHT 134

Snape and the others race toward the edge of the grounds.
Suddenly, Snape pulls up, looks back. Sees Harry
sprinting toward him. Malfoy, looking edgy, is watching
Harry too.

SNAPE
Go on!

(CONTINUED)

135.
134 CONTINUED: 134
Just then a GIANT FIREBALL erupts into the sky. Snape
wheels, sees Bellatrix and the others silhouetted against
the flames. They’ve set Hagrid’s Hut ablaze. Malfoy
stands paralyzed.

SNAPE
Go on!

NEW ANGLE – HARRY

Running. Harry bolts forth, wand in hand, vengeance in
his eyes. Up ahead, Snape stands stolidly, tall and
black against the raging fire. Harry points his wand,
fires a JET of RED LIGHT. Snape doesn’t move, merely
lets it streak by his head. Harry stops, chest heaving,
and takes aim again.
HARRY
Cruciatus!
Snape raises his wand, parries the curse with ease.

HARRY
Incacerata!
Once again, Snape deflects the spell.

HARRY
Impedimenta!
Another lazy flick of the arm, another curse defeated.
Harry drops his arm in frustration.

HARRY
Fight! Fight back, you coward!
With staggering quickness, Snape’s wand whips forth and
Harry is off his heels and crashing to the earth.

SNAPE
Don’t ever associate that word and
my name again.

Harry raises himself up on one knee, points his wand
when… a JET of RED LIGHT sends him crashing back into
the grass. Snape wheels, sees Bellatrix standing behind.

SNAPE
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord!

Bellatrix eyes Snape levelly, then turns, trots off.
Snape glances at Harry, then turns away himself, walking.
Harry grimaces, pulls himself to his feet and aims one
last time.

HARRY
Sectumsempra!
Bang! Snape wheels and once more sends Harry flying onto
his back. Harry stares at the stars as they wheel over
him, when Snape comes INTO VIEW.

SNAPE
You dare use my own spells against
me, Potter?

Harry goes still. His eyes shift, meet Snape’s.

SNAPE
You may have gotten your mother’s
eyes, but you’re as dim as your
father. Yes. It’s me. I’m the
Half-Blood Prince.

Snape kicks Harry’s wand aside and turns away, joining
Malfoy and the others where they wait beyond the flaming
ruins of Hagrid’s Hut. They head for the darkness of the
treeline. And VANISH. Harry pounds his fist into the
ground, then stops.

HARRY
Hagrid… HAGRID!

Harry races toward the hut when the DOOR flies off its
hinges. Seconds later, Hagrid stumbles out, beard
SMOKING.

HARRY
Hagrid! You alright?

HAGRID
Take more’n tha’ ter finish me
off. Not sure about me `ouse,
tho’. But if anybody can put it
righ’, Dumbledore can.

HARRY
Hagrid, Dumbledore –

HAGRID
Only thing I can’t reckon is wha’
Snape was doin’ with tha’ lot.

Hagrid turns then, sees the HUGE THRONG of STUDENTS and
STAFF assembled outside the castle.

HAGRID
An’ wha’s this wi’ the Dark Mar’?
Who’s been killed?
(stopping)
Where’s Dumbledore, `arry?
Where’s Dumbledore!!
Harry tries to speak, but he is mute. Hagrid goes still.

135 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE – MIDDLE COURTYARD – NIGHT 135

Ron, Hermione and Ginny stand with the staff. They turn
and watch the throng of students part for Harry and
Hagrid.

Hagrid stops short, shattered by what he sees. Harry
pushes on, kneels. Dumbledore’s eyes are closed, his
face peaceful. Harry straightens his half-moon
spectacles, wipes a trickle of blood from his mouth.
Runs the back of his hand, gently, over the weathered
cheek.

Then he notices something lying beside Dumbledore’s ashen
hand: the locket. He takes it, considers it numbly.
Then begins to cry, great shudders of grief wracking his
body. Hermione gives Ginny a nudge and she steps
forward, drops beside him. At her touch, his head falls
on her shoulder and she begins to stroke him. Ron looks
on. Understands all.

McGonagall lifts a trembling wand to the sky and slowly
the TIP GLOWS to life. One after another, students and
staff do the same, lifting their wands in salute. As
CAMERA RISES, the pinpricks coalesce into one BLAZING
FIRE. The sky, briefly emerald, turns black once more.
The Dark Mark vanishes.

136 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE – DAY 136

The castle sits silent. BLACK BANNERS fly on the
parapets.

136A EXT. BRIDGE – DAY 136A

Silent. Desolate.

137 INT. GREAT HALL – DAY 137

Dumbledore’s chair — empty. The House tables — empty.

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 137A.

138 INT. CORRIDOR – DAY 138

A tapestry tosses lightly in the breeze. The PERCH in
the empty birdcage sways, SQUEAKING gently.

138.

139 INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE – DAY 139

Quiet. Still. Empty. Then:

The door eases OPEN and Harry enters. For a moment, he
simply stands staring. Taking inventory. Spying
something, he crosses to the great desk opposite. Looks
down.

Dumbledore’s wand.

Reaching out, Harry takes it in hand. Old, oft-used and
bearing the impression of its owner’s fingers, it is a
strangely beautiful object. Harry traces his thumb
lightly over the wood, transfixed, when…

… McGonagall enters.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Potter.

He doesn’t respond, lost in the wand. McGonagall’s eyes
drift to it, briefly, then study Harry’s face. She
frowns, trying to call forth some words.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Potter, in light of what’s
happened… should you feel the
need to talk to someone…

She falters. Harry gently sets the wand back upon the
desk, retraces his steps to the door, pauses for one last
look.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
You should know… Professor
Dumbledore…

Harry turns then, studying her drawn face, no words
necessary. At a loss, she finishes quietly:

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
You meant a great deal to him.

Harry’s eyes rise. High upon the wall, the past
Headmasters snooze in their frames. The last looks
remarkably peaceful, the trace of a smile on his lips as
he sleeps.

Dumbledore.

Harry nods, lingering one last moment, and exits.

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 138A.

140 INT. TOWER DORMITORY – DAY 140

Harry stands at the window, alone in the empty dormitory.
At the doorway, he looks back. As if committing it to
memory.

141 INT. COMMON ROOM – DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 141

Harry starts down the stairs, stops. Hermione, Ron and
Ginny sit talking quietly. Ginny looks up. Smiles
softly.

142 EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER – DAY 142

Harry and Hermione stand by the ramparts while Ron and
Ginny stand further along, just out of earshot. Harry
stares into the distance at the ashes of Hagrid’s Hut.
Hermione toys with the locket before them.

HERMIONE
Do you think he would’ve done it.
Draco?

HARRY
No. He was lowering his wand. In
the end, it was Snape. It was
always Snape. And I did
nothing…

Hermione studies Harry, takes the locket from the
rampart.

HERMIONE
Strange. Thinking this is a piece
of Voldemort’s soul…

HARRY
Yeah, strange. Only… it’s not.
It’s a fake.

As Hermione reacts, Harry nods.

HARRY
Go on. Open it.

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 139.
142 CONTINUED: 142
Hermione pries open the locket and removes a piece of
PARCHMENT folded in a tight square. READS:

HERMIONE
`To the Dark Lord. I know I will
be dead long before you read this
but I want you to know that it was
I who discovered your secret. I
have stolen the real Horcrux and
intend to destroy it as soon as I
can. I face death in the hope
that when you meet your match, you
will be mortal once more. R.A.B.’
(looking up)
R.A.B.?

HARRY
Dunno. But whoever they are, they
have the real Horcrux. Which
means, it was a waste. All of it.

Hermione studies Harry’s troubled face, then glances at
Ginny and Ron.

HERMIONE
Ron’s okay with it, you know. You
and Ginny. But if I were you,
when he’s around, I’d keep the
snogging to a minimum.

Hermione smiles faintly, trying to cheer him, but Harry
merely nods, looks away again.

HARRY
I’m not coming back, Hermione.
Hermione nods.

HERMIONE
We reckoned — Ron and me.

HARRY
I have to finish what Dumbledore
started. I’m not sure where that
will lead me… but I’ll let you
and Ron konw where I am — when I
can. (ALT: I have to finish what
Dumbledore started. And… I have
to do it alone.)

HERMIONE
I’ve always admired your courage,
Harry, but sometimes… you’re
really thick.

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 140.
142 CONTINUED: (2) 142
Harry turns, looking at her in surprise.

HERMIONE
You don’t honestly think you can
find all those Horcruxes by
yourself, do you?
(leaning in; a
whisper)

You need us, Harry.
Harry just stares at her. She cocks her head, smiling,
doing her best to coax one out of him. Finally, he does,
briefly.

HARRY
Yeah. I do. But do me a favor.
When I’m around? Keep the
snogging to a minimum.

Hermione looks stunned. Reddens.

HERMIONE
Like that’s going to happen.

She glances at Ron, shakes her head.

HERMIONE
Besides, he’s barking.

HARRY
Funny, he says the same about you.

HERMIONE
Yes, but I’m exceptionally
perceptive.
HARRY
You’re brilliant. You both are.

Harry looks off again and Hermione follows his gaze. She
looks out over the grounds. Slowly losing herself. We
can tell. She’s taking inventory. Pressing it into a
scrapbook.

HERMIONE
Do you think we’ll ever… (come
back?)

She stops. Her eyes glisten briefly. Then she fights it
back. Tough. Harry fights back his own emotion, reaches
over and gives her hand a brief squeeze. Then releases
her.

(CONTINUED)

HARRY POTTER… HALF-BLOOD PRINCE – Rev. 11/6/07 141.
142 CONTINUED: (3) 142
HARRY
I don’t know.

Hermione nods and Harry’s eyes shift, consider Ron and
Ginny. As if sensing his gaze, Ron turns and they
exchange a look, something unspoken but true passing
between them.

Just then a SONG rises on the air, mournful and haunting,
and seconds later a BIRD soars out from beyond the
tallest turret and begins to stitch its way across the
sky.

Ron and Ginny cross to Harry and Hermione, lean against
the rampart. All look to the horizon, watching the bird
grow smaller while its song — magically — endures.
No one says a word.

FADE OUT.

THE END
